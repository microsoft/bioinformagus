      "   - Use a variant visualization tool like IGV, Integrative Genomics Viewer, or Tableau to visualize the variants and their genomic context.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Phylogenetic analysis:\n",
      "   - Use a phylogenetic analysis tool like MEGA, RAxML, or BEAST to construct a phylogenetic tree of the identified variants and compare them to reference sequences.\n",
      "   - Use a variant clustering tool like Roary or SURPI to group the variants into lineages and track their evolution over time.\n",

      "7. Reporting:\n",
      "   - Use a reporting tool like Jupyter Notebook, R Markdown, or Quarto to create a report summarizing the results of the analysis and highlighting the key findings.\n",

      "- The sequencing data format (e.g., FASTQ, BAM, CRAM)\n",
      "- The sequencing platform (e.g., Illumina, Nanopore)\n",
      "- The reference genome sequence (e.g., NC_045512.2, GISAID accession number)\n",
      "- The desired output format (e.g., HTML, PDF, CSV)\n",
      "- The computational resources available (e.g., CPU cores, RAM, disk space)\n",
      "- The software and tools to be used (e.g., Python, R, Docker)\n",
      "- The level of expertise of the user (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced)\n",

      "The student should be advised to have a basic understanding of bioinformatics tools and workflows, as well as access to the necessary computational resources and software. They should also be familiar with the sequencing data format and the reference genome sequence. The student should be able to use Python or R for data analysis and visualization, and have access to Docker for running bioinformatics tools. The desired output format and level of expertise will determine the complexity of the workflow and the level of detail in the report.\n"
