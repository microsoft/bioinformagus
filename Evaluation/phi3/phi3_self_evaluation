In this modified script, the help information is only printed if `params.help` evaluates to true. The `pre` block checks the value of `params_help`, and based on that, it either displays the usage information or proceeds with executing the workflow as usual. This approach ensures that the help section will not be displayed when running your Nextflow script without arguments (`nextflow run idx.nf`).",5,2.0,2
"I am currently using BWA-MEM to map metagenomic reads to a small (~12kb) virus reference genome for a large number of samples. I have a lot of reads per sample - upwards of 10 million.The majority of the reads (~99%) do not match my reference - I am not interested in analysing these reads. However, the .sam file that BWA-MEM produces stores the unmapped reads, and I am stuck with these huge files that are taking up disk space (I do convert these into sorted .bam files and delete the .sam file, but they're still huge). Is there any way to stop BWA-MEM from storing the unmapped reads in the .sam file and only keep the mapped reads? Thank you for letting me know.","<pre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">bwa mem (...) | samtools view -F 4 -o onlyMapped.bam/code></pre>See <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html"">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html</a> "," Yes, it is possible to modify your workflow to avoid storing unmapped reads using BWA-MEM. Instead of directly outputting the SAM files that include all reads (mapped and unmapped), you can redirect these outputs into temporary files or use an intermediate step where only mapped reads are written out. Here's a general approach:

1. Run your BWA-MEM alignment command, but instead of writing directly to .sam files, write the output to temporary files using redirection (e.g., `bwa mem -t 4 ... | tee mapped_reads.sam >/dev/null`). The `-t` option is used for threading and can help speed up the process if you have a multi-core machine.

2. After running BWA-MEM, use a tool like `samtools view -bS -F 4` to filter out unmapped reads from your temporary .sam file (the `-F 4` option filters out all but mapped reads). This will give you a binary SAM/BAM file containing only the mapped reads.

3. Convert this filtered BAM file into a sorted and indexed format using `samtools sort -o sorted_reads.bam`, which is more efficient for downstream analyses.

4. Once you have your .bam file with only mapped reads, you can delete the temporary .sam files if necessary to free up disk space.

By following this approach, you will be able to avoid storing large unmapped read files and keep only the data that is relevant for your analysis.",4,4.0,4
"Hi all,I'm trying to align a fastq file to a reference fasta file using bwa mem and for the life of me I keep getting the following error message. Any thoughts?

This issue typically arises when the indexing step hasn't been completed successfully before attempting alignment with `bwa mem`.

To resolve this, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a valid BWA installation and that it supports index creation (BWA-MEM).
2. Run the command to create an index for your reference fasta file using `bwa index` as follows:

```bash
bwa index -p myref_index/ myref.fasta
```

This will generate necessary files (`myref.amb`, `myref.bwt`, etc.) in the specified output directory (`myref_index/` in this example). Make sure to replace it with your desired path if needed.

3. Once you have successfully created the index, proceed with aligning your fastq file using `bwa mem`:

```bash
bwa mem -M 1 -R '@RG\tID:{foo}.{bar}\tPU:{foo}.{bar}.{999999}\tSM:{999999}\tPL:{foo}\tLB{bar}' myref_index/myfasta.amb myfastq.fastq.gz
```

Replace `{foo}` and `{bar}` with appropriate identifiers for your samples, as well as adjust the reference index path (`myref_index/`) according to where you stored it after indexing.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of BWA not locating the necessary index files and successfully align your fastq file using `bwa mem`.",3,2.0,4
"Hi,I wonder whether it's better to remove weakly aligned parts of proteins from MSA or keep them for building HMM?Case: Let's say I have a bunch of homologs and I want to generate HMM (hidden Markov-model) to be able to detect their homologs from distinct species. Questions:ol>li>Shall I use all available homologs or there is some reasonable limit (min: 5 or 15? max: 50, 100, 200)? I keep in mind that alignment gets worse the more sequnce is incorporate, plus MSA software has their limitations as well.</li>li>Which MSA program will you recommend? Personally, I like MUSCLE a lot, but I'm aware MAFFT or T-Coffee perform better (but slower).</li>li>Or shall I use more aligners and used consistency based alignment (M-coffee)?</li>li>Shall I trim badly align fragments (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://trimal.cgenomics.org/"">trimAl</a> or <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks.html1.2.3."">gBlocks</a>)? </li>/ol>Cheers,","Unless your protein be something new, the best way to proceed is by looking for pre-aligned manually seeds in places like <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/"">Pfam</a> or Kadher Shameer's <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://caps.ncbs.res.in/3pfdb/"">3PFDB</a>. With a seed in hand, you don't need to align from scratch. And you could use it to search for homologs at a specified distance. Remember that packages like hmmbuild down-weight closely related sequences and up-weight distant ones during hmm building. So, you must select mostly distant candidates. Keep a few close ones just to sustain a little bit more of homology signal.The main question is: which aligment tool should I use? Well, if you have a seed then most aligners will return pretty the same result after a realigment. But, aligning from scratch can be painful. I do recommend <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/webprank/"">PRANK</a> which is phylogeny-aware or ClustalW with iterate each step option turned on (very, very, very slow but way more reliable).Anyway you should consider the Pfam approach, i.e., searching piece by piece ((sub)domain, motifs, etc.). I've used this to reannotate selenoproteins in Kinetoplastida and was able to find things that even JGI crew missed."," When building an HMM for detecting homologous proteins across distinct species using multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), it is generally advisable to remove weakly aligned parts of proteins from MSA before constructing your HMM. This helps improve the accuracy and reliability of the model by focusing on well-aligned regions that are more likely to be conserved among homologs.

Regarding the number of available homologs, there is no strict rule for a minimum or maximum limit; however, it's essential to strike a balance between having enough data and maintaining alignment quality. A reasonable range could be 10-50 homologs per species, depending on your specific dataset and research goals.

For MSA programs, both MAFFT and T-Coffee are excellent choices for generating high-quality alignments, with MAFFT being faster than T-Coffee but potentially sacrificing some accuracy. If you prefer speed over absolute precision, MAFFT is a good option to consider. However, if your dataset allows it, using both programs and comparing the results can help ensure that you're working with the most accurate alignment possible.

Using multiple aligners and consistency-based alignment tools like MUSCLE or M-coffee could be beneficial in some cases, but this approach may introduce additional complexity to your workflow. It is essential to weigh the benefits against potential drawbacks before deciding on a strategy.

Regarding trimming poorly aligned fragments from MSAs, tools like Trimal and Gblocks can help improve alignment quality by removing low-quality regions or gaps that may negatively impact HMM construction. Using these tools to clean up your MSA data will likely result in better model performance when detecting homologous proteins across species.

In summary, it's generally advisable to remove weakly aligned parts of proteins from MSAs before building an HMM for protein homology detection. Aim for a reasonable number of homologs (e.g., 10-50 per species) and consider using MAFFT or T-Coffee, depending on your specific needs. Additionally, employing trimming tools like Trimal and Gblocks can help improve the quality of your MSA data for more accurate HMM construction.",4,4.0,4
"Hello everybody, Could anyone tell me how to get SNPs using <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://samtools.sourceforge.net/"">SAMtools</a>???. I am learning how to do it but canÂ´t get the SNPs, I only get the Indels. I am working with a mutant I created from an E coli genome (just for practice). The mutant was created with 5 mismatches, 5 insertions and 5 deletions (using Biopieces). The lenght and coverage is here: pre><code>read_fasta -i  &lt;fasta ref genome&gt;.fna | shred_seq -s 100 -c 50 | add_ident -k SEQ_NAME | write_fasta -x -o  &lt;rrreads&gt;.fna/code></pre>The alignment was made with <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"">BWA</a> .

Thanks!!! :)","First simple thing to try: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://samtools.sourceforge.net/"">samtools</a> mpileup -Buf.  Sometimes, the BAQ calculations will wrongly believe real SNPs to be undiagnosed indels, and will drop their quality in the pileup step such that they can't be called as SNPsSince you know where your missing SNPs are, look at them in the pileup text file.  If the SNP is detected, but the quality score is terrible, despite being fine in the .bams, that's what happened."," To obtain SNPs using SAMtools, you need to follow these steps:

1. Align your reads to the reference genome using BWA or another aligner tool. In your case, you have already aligned the reads with BWA and obtained a sorted bam file named `result.sort.bam`.
2. Use SAMtools mpileup command to generate a pileup format file containing information about each position in the reference genome:
   ```
   samtools mpileup -uf <reference_genome>.fasta result.sort.bam > results.bcf
   ```
3. Filter out indels from the `results.bcf` file using bcftools view command, and keep only SNPs (single nucleotide variants):
   ```
   bcftools view -v snps -O z <results.bcf> > test.vcf.gz
   ```
   Here, `-v snps` option filters out indels from the pileup file and `-O z` outputs in compressed (gzip) format. The resulting `test.vcf.gz` file contains only SNPs.

By following these steps, you should be able to obtain a VCF file containing only SNPs for your E. coli mutant genome.",4,4.0,5
Hi everyoneI have a question regarding BWA mem alignmentI was interested in finding out the performance gains I would obtain from creating a artificial reference where I masked everything I was not interested in my panel.In short I blated all my regions of interest on my panel and created a masked fasta file of the Human hg19 where I masked with N anyregion that would not have some degree of sequence similarity to my regions of interest This basicaly masked around 90% of the human genome. I then created a BWA index with that masked fasta file and aligned my samples (that I had already previously done with the normal human reference) to see if there was any performance gains in terms of the time it took to align them.To my surprise the alignment against this much smaller reference (same length as the human genome but with over 90% of bases MAsked) was slower than the normal alignment against the hg19 assembly.Can someone tell me why this is?Many thanksDuarte,"The masking doesnt make the reference genome smaller, it's the same basepair length. <br>What masking does however is let your reads possibly align in many more places. Every masked section could be a match to either end of your read. So rather than using BWA's intelligent ""seed"" technique to limit alignment time, you've forced it to look in many more places for candidate sites.I have seen this problem with GATK's HaplotypeCaller when looking near the centromere's run of many AAAA. The thing gets stuck in a loop trying millions of possible alignments for every read."," The observed performance degradation when aligning your samples to the masked reference could be due to several factors. Firstly, BWA mem uses seed-merging strategy for alignment which may not perform optimally with highly sparse or artificial references like yours. This is because it relies on finding high-scoring pairs (HSPs) between query and target sequences, but the masked regions in your reference might disrupt this process. Secondly, BWA mem also employs a heuristic approach to handle ambiguous alignments which could be less efficient with artificial references that lack comprehensive sequence similarity across all genomic regions. Lastly, creating an artificial reference and indexing it can introduce overheads not present when using the standard human genome index. It's worth exploring alternative alignment tools or strategies tailored for masked or customized reference alignments to potentially achieve better performance gains.",2,2.0,2

Bowtie is an ultrafast memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads against a reference genome. It uses the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm, which allows it to efficiently handle large genomes with millions of short sequences. Bowtie has two main modes: Bowtie and Bowtie2. The default mapping quality score for Bowtie is 10, while the base quality score ranges from 0 to 40 (with higher scores indicating better confidence).

On the other hand, BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) uses a different approach called the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm as well. However, it has two main algorithms: BWA-backtrack and BWA-MEM. The default mapping quality score for BWA is 2, while its base quality scores range from 0 to 41.
 Written by @Senior Bioinformatician

The difference in the reported variant calls between Bowtie and BWA can be attributed to their alignment strategies and scoring systems. The mapping quality score (MQ) reflects the confidence of the alignment, while the base quality score represents the likelihood that a particular nucleotide is correctly called. 

In your case, it seems like Bowtie's lower mapping quality score may have resulted in fewer variant calls because its scoring system might not be as stringent as BWA's. However, this does not necessarily mean that Bowtie's results are less accurate; rather, they reflect the different algorithms and parameters used by each tool.

To improve your alignment analysis, you can experiment with adjusting the parameters of both tools to see if it affects the mapping quality scores and variant calls. Additionally, consider using a reference genome that is better suited for your specific dataset or aligner. Finally, ensure that you are using appropriate filtering criteria when calling variants based on the alignment results from either Bowtie or BWA.",3,2.0,3
"I've got a bam file of paired-end illumina sequences mapped to a reference sequence and I was wondering if when I call the samtools view command if the results represent only reads that completely span over the region of interest or if it also included reads that intersect it by one or two base pairs.

This means it can return reads like ""case_1"" which only partially overlap the ROI by one base pair.

If you want to filter out reads that do not fully cover the ROI, there are a few approaches you could consider:

1. **Using `samtools view` with `-r`:** You can use the `-r` option in `samtools view` to restrict the output to only those alignments within the specified region of interest. However, this will still include reads that partially overlap the ROI by one or two base pairs.

2. **Using a custom script:** You could write a custom script using tools like `awk`, `grep`, or even Python (with libraries such as Biopython) to filter out reads based on their alignment positions relative to your region of interest. This approach would allow you more control over the filtering criteria, enabling you to exclude reads that only partially overlap the ROI by one or two base pairs.

Here's an example using `awk` and `samtools view`:

```bash
# Define your region of interest (ROI) in chromosome:start-end format
ROI=""chr1:10000-20000""

# Use samtools view to get all alignments, then filter using awk
samtools view input.bam | awk -v roi=""$ROI"" 'BEGIN { split(roi, start_end) } 
{ chrom = $1; pos = $2; if (start_end[1] <= pos && pos <= start_end[2]) print }' > filtered_output.sam
```

This `awk` script filters out alignments based on their position relative to the specified ROI, excluding reads that only partially overlap it by one or two base pairs. You can adjust the filtering criteria as needed for your specific use case.",3,3.0,3

1. Sort each input VCF file by chromosome and position before merging them using `bcftools`. This will help to avoid duplicates caused by different orderings of variants in separate files. You can sort your VCF files with a command like this:

```bash
for i in {ms01e_phased.vcf.gz, ms02g_phased.vcf.gz, ...}; do
  bcftools view -O z -f - $i | awk '$3 ~ /^[[:digit:]]+$/ && !seen[$1,$2]++ {print}' > ${i}.sorted;
done
```

This will create sorted VCF files for each input file.

2. Merge the sorted VCF files using `bcftools merge` with the `-O v` option to output a VCF format and specifying all sample names in one command:

```bash
for i in {ms01e_phased.vcf.gz, ms02g_phased.vcf.gz, ...}; do
  bcftools merge -O v ${i}.sorted > merged_${i}.vcf;
done
```

3. Finally, concatenate the sorted and merged VCF files using `cat` to create a single multi-sample VCF file:

```bash
cat {ms01e_phased.vcf.gz, ms02g_phased.vcf.gz, ...} > RBphased_variants.SixSamples.Final.vcf
```

This approach should help you merge the VCF files without encountering duplicate records due to different orderings of variants in separate files.",5,2.0,2
"Hi,I have a somewhat high content of mitochondrial RNA in my RNA-seq experiment. Is there a way to use samtools to remove alignments to the 'MT' chromosome and keep all the rest?I'm considering using samtools view in combination with awk but perhaps there's a better/cleaner solution?Thanks!","You can use samtools to do it by selecting particular chromosomes and never leaving the binary format, for example:pre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">samtools view -b input.bam chr1 chr2 chr3 chr4 &gt; output.bam/code></pre>That's a bit unwieldy to list all non-mitochondrial chromosomes manually, so you could try an ugly bash one-liner like:pre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">samtools idxstats input.bam | cut -f 1 | grep -v MT | xargs samtools view -b input.bam &gt; output.bam/code></pre>"," Yes, you can definitely use samtools along with other tools like awk or grep to filter out alignments to the 'MT' chromosome and keep all others. Here is one way of doing it:

Firstly, you need to sort your BAM file using `samtools sort`. This will ensure that all reads are in a sorted order which can be beneficial for subsequent operations. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
samtools sort input.bam output_sorted.bam
```

Then, you can use `awk` to filter out alignments to 'MT'. The `-v` option in awk allows us to set a variable which we will use as our condition. Here's how you could do it:

```bash
samtools view -h output_sorted.bam | awk '$3 != ""MT"" {print}' > filtered.bam
```

In this command, `$3` refers to the third column of your SAM file which is typically chromosome information. The condition `!='MT'` filters out alignments that are on 'MT'. The `-h` option in samtools view prints all fields including the header lines. The output is redirected into a new BAM file called filtered.bam, which contains only those alignments not mapped to 'MT'.

This approach should give you a clean solution for your problem. However, please remember that this method assumes that chromosome information in your SAM/BAM files are correctly formatted and consistently labeled as 'MT' for mitochondrial chromosomes. If the format is different or inconsistent, you might need to adjust the condition accordingly.",4,5.0,4
"Hi all:I recently got quite confused with two SAM flags got from BWA alignment, which is ""<strong>supplementary alignment</strong>"" from chimeric alignments and ""<strong>not primary alignment</strong>"" (or ""secondary alignment"") from multiple mapping.strong>What samtools explain about these two flags is:</strong>(Refer to <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)"">https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf)</a>A chimeric alignment is primarily caused by structural variations, gene fusions, misassemblies, RNA-seq or experimental protocols. It is more frequent given longer reads. For a chimeric alignment, the linear alignments consisting of the alignment are largely non-overlapping. Typically, one of the linear alignments in a chimeric alignment is considered the ""representative"" alignment, and the others are called ""supplementary"" and are distinguished by the supplementary alignment flag.  In contrast, multiple mappings are caused primarily by repeats. They are less frequent given longer reads. If a read has multiple mappings, all these mappings are almost entirely overlapping with each other. In multiple mapping, One of these alignments is considered ""primary"". All the other alignments have the ""secondary"" alignment flag set in the SAM records that represent them.strong>However</strong>, I found in my ChIP-seq alignment results got from BWA(without -M option), alignments with ""supplementary"" flags are with overlaps with ""representative"" alignments,which I think should be ""secondary"" alignments as described.

Should I remove these ""supplementary"" alignments to keep uniquely mapped reads? Thanks very much.Best,Vanilla","Those are proper supplemental alignments, since there's no way to map the entire reads in a biologically coherent manner. A secondary alignment would occur if those reads mapped elsewhere in the genome (i.e., not overlapping like this).Anyway, yes, you can go ahead and remove those for most downstream applications. One caveat to this is that you might have a structural variation there (tandem repeat)."," The confusion arises from the interpretation of SAM flags for supplementary and secondary alignments. According to samtools documentation (https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), ""supplementary alignment"" refers to an additional mapping that is not part of the primary or best alignment, while ""secondary alignment"" indicates multiple mappings for a single read.

In your case, it seems like you are observing supplementary alignments with overlaps in ChIP-seq results from BWA (without using -M option). These supplementary alignments appear to be fragments of the primary or best alignments rather than independent secondary alignments. Therefore, they should not necessarily be removed as they provide valuable information about alternative mapping regions within a single read.

To summarize, in your specific scenario, ""supplementary"" alignments are overlapping fragments of the main alignment and do not represent separate secondary alignments. It is recommended to retain these supplementary alignments for further analysis rather than removing them as uniquely mapped reads.",3,,5
"Hello, I am pretty new to bioinformatics and to this forum, and would very much appreciate any suggestions you could offer to help me with ways to filter my alignments (obtained using bwa mem) so I only have uniquely mapped reads, other than using q scores (which I have already done and doesn't solve my problem)? Here is a bit more explanation: I am trying to obtain uniquely mapped reads from my bwa mem alignments to use in downstream analyses. I realize that ""uniquely mapped reads"" is a loaded term, and that most sources I have found on the topic suggest filtering by q score should do the trick. My problem is that I have tried filtering by progressively higher q scores and I still have a (very small) number of reads that appear to not be uniquely mapped. Because I am aligning my reads from each sample to 96 different loci (in bwa), I want to make sure my reads are only mapped to one locus. For the one sample I am using to test out commands, I filtered my data so I only have properly paired reads and mapped reads (in the case of my unpaired reads) and also filtered by q score (I get nearly the same results at q of 10, 20, or 30, so it's not an issue of changing the q score level), merged all my bam files, and obtained 193,998 reads total for that sample. When I open the bam file in Geneious and count the number of reads for each locus they add up to 194, 050. I realize the difference between these two numbers is an incredibly small number of reads, and I am going to only use loci that have ~20 or 30 mapped reads for each sample (haven't yet decided on that threshold) so maybe this doesn't matter terribly much in the grand scheme, but I still would like to have these two numbers match so I am not incorrectly including loci that weren't actually sequenced for a particular sample. I have also seen suggestions to filter by XT tags, but none of my files have this tag. I DO have the XS tag (most seem to be XS:i:0). My understanding of what XS:i:0 means is a bit shaky, but I think it means that the secondary alignment has a score of zero so these would be reads that only have one alignment? And maybe this could be a good tag to use for filtering? strong>So my question is this: Does anyone have any suggestions for other tags or filtering steps I can use for my data so that my reads only map to one location, other than filtering for q score (which I have already done and will do in addition to any other filtering steps)?</strong> Here is the applicable portion of code that I am running on alignments obtained from bwa (sorted them by coordinate and converted them to bam already in a previous step). The first line is what I'm using on my paired-end file and the second line is what I am using on my unpaired read 1 file (using the same code for my unpaired read 2 file). Note that I used trimmomatic to remove low quality bases from my reads, which is why I have three different read files for each sample. pre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">samtools view -q 10 -f 0x02 -b pe001_sorted.bam &gt; pe001_sorted_properlypaired.bamsamtools view -q 10 -F 0x04 -b unpaired1_sorted.bam &gt; unpaired1_sorted_mapped.bam/code></pre>Thank you very much for any help you can offer!","The XT tag was used by early versions of bwa but not bwa-mem, which is like the new version for all intents and purposes.The XT tag is mainly seen these days as the tag for marking adapter sequences in the GATK best practices workflow.Any tag that starts with an ""X"", ""Y"", or ""Z"" are user-defined, which means it's going to be unique to the tool that put them in the file. It's a real shame that tags have this 2-character limitation and can't just say what it is that they do, but meh. Bioinformatics amiright.The issue your having is most likely due to a totally non-intuitive aspect of the SAM format, where data is allowed to be wrong provided you can figure out that it's wrong. For example, a read can have ""mapped in a proper pair"" set, but if it's also unmapped, then you are supposed to recognise that the ""mapped in a proper pair == true"" is actually false.So long story short, you can't use 0x02 on it's own. You have to  say ""i don't want unmapped reads, and i do want properly paired reads"" which is -F 0x04 -f 0x02.

While q-score filtering has been your initial approach, it seems that some non-uniquely mapped reads still persist in your data. Here are a few suggestions for additional steps you can take:

1. Utilize the XS tag (XTags): The XS tag indicates secondary alignments with a score of zero. This means these reads have only one alignment, which could be useful for filtering out non-uniquely mapped reads. You can use `samtools view` to filter your BAM files based on this tag:

samtools view -q 1 Written in March of 2015, this article discusses the importance of understanding and managing risk within organizations. It emphasizes that while no one can predict the future with certainty, it is crucial to have a proactive approach towards identifying potential risks and developing strategies to mitigate them. The author highlights several key points:

1. **Risk Management as an Ongoing Process**: Risk management should not be seen as a one-time activity but rather as an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, assessment, and adjustment. Organizations must establish a culture of risk awareness where every individual understands their role in identifying and managing risks.

2. **The Role of Leadership**: Effective leadership is essential for successful risk management. Leaders should foster an environment that encourages open communication, collaboration, and the sharing of ideas related to risk identification and mitigation strategies. They must also ensure that adequate resources are allocated towards risk management activities.

3. **Risk Identification**: The first step in managing risks is identifying them. This involves conducting thorough analyses, such as SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis, PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) analysis, and scenario planning exercises. These tools help organizations anticipate potential risks by examining internal and external factors that could impact their operations.

4. **Risk Assessment**: Once risks are identified, they must be assessed in terms of their likelihood and potential impact on the organization. This assessment helps prioritize risks based on their severity and guides decision-making regarding risk mitigation strategies.

5. **Mitigation Strategies**: Developing effective risk mitigation strategies is crucial to minimizing the negative effects of identified risks. These strategies can include diversifying operations, implementing contingency plans, investing in insurance, and adopting new technologies or processes that reduce vulnerabilities.

6. **Communication**: Effective communication plays a vital role in risk management. Organizations should establish clear channels for communicating risks to relevant stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, and regulators. This ensures transparency and enables timely responses when addressing potential issues.

7. **Monitoring and Review**: Risk management is an iterative process that requires regular monitoring and review to ensure its effectiveness. Organizations should establish mechanisms for tracking the implementation of risk mitigation strategies, evaluating their outcomes, and making necessary adjustments based on changing circumstances or new information.

8. **Learning from Experience**: Finally, organizations must learn from past experiences with risks to improve future risk management efforts. This involves analyzing incidents that occurred despite mitigation strategies in place, identifying lessons learned, and incorporating these insights into the organization's overall approach towards managing risks.

In conclusion, understanding and effectively managing risks is essential for organizations to thrive amidst uncertainty. By adopting a proactive approach that involves continuous monitoring, assessment, communication, and learning from experiences, organizations can better prepare themselves to navigate challenges and seize opportunities in an ever-changing business landscape.",5,0.0,0
"Samtools can be used to select reads above certain mapping quality. pre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">samtools view -h -b -q 30 aligned.bam -o above.mapQ30.bam/code></pre>strong>But, how to select a read below certain mapping quality - all aligned reads below mapQ 30?</strong>I know it can be done using awk. But, the pipeline gets lengthy and time consuming when first need to convert bam to sam - separate header - use awk for mapQ below 30 - add header - sam file - convert to bam.Really, its taking a lots of time.Thanks,","Use SAMtools with the -U flag to output reads that don't match your filter, e.g.blockquote>  samtools view -h -b -q 30 -U below_q30.bam aligned.bam/blockquote>"," To select reads with mapping quality below a certain threshold (e.g., below Q30) from an aligned BAM file using Samtools without converting it to SAM format and then back to BAM, you can directly use the `-q` option followed by a negative value for filtering out reads based on their mapping quality score. This approach is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary conversions between formats.

Here's how you can achieve this:

```bash
samtools view -hb aligned.bam -q 30- > below_mapQ30.bam
```

This command filters out reads with a mapping quality score of 30 or higher, effectively selecting all reads with a mapping quality below Q30 and saving the result into `below_mapQ30.bam`. The `-h` option includes header information from the original BAM file, while `-b` outputs in binary format (BAM).

This method is efficient because it directly processes the BAM file without converting to SAM format first, significantly reducing processing time and simplifying your pipeline. This approach should meet your requirements for selecting reads below a certain mapping quality threshold with minimal complexity and improved performance.",5,2.0,1
"Hi,I came across this in STAR aligner:--outSAMattributes Allthe manual says it includes: NH HI AS NM NM MD jM jIwhere can I find what these mean?Thanks,","""Sequence Alignment/Map Optional Fields Specication"" <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf"">http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf</a> "," The ""outSAMattributes"" parameter in STAR aligner is used to specify additional SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) attributes that will be included in the output file. Here's an explanation of each attribute you mentioned:

1. NH - Number of high-quality bases aligned to a read: This represents the total number of bases in the alignment where at least one base has a quality score above a certain threshold (usually 20). It helps assess the overall quality of the alignment.

2. HI - Percentage of high-quality bases aligned to a read: This is calculated by dividing NH by the total number of bases in the read and multiplying it by 100, giving you an idea of how many high-quality bases are present in the alignment relative to the entire sequence.

3. AS - Alignment score (SAM format): The alignment score is a measure of the quality of the alignment between the reference genome and the read. It takes into account factors such as mapping quality, base pairing accuracy, and mismatches. A higher score indicates better alignment.

4. NM - Number of mismatches in an alignment: This attribute counts the number of positions where there is a difference between the aligned sequence (read) and the reference genome. It helps identify potential errors or variations in the read.

5. NM - Maximum number of mismatches allowed for an alignment to be considered valid: This parameter sets a threshold on how many mismatches are acceptable for an alignment to be included in the output file. Alignments with more than this specified number of mismatches will not be reported, which can help filter out low-quality alignments.

6. MD - Mismatch quality scores (SAM format): This attribute provides a list of mismatch quality scores corresponding to each position where there is a difference between the aligned sequence and reference genome. It helps identify potential errors or variations in the alignment, with higher values indicating better quality for that particular base pair.

7. jM - Number of bases excluded from an alignment due to soft-clipping: This attribute counts the number of bases at either end of a read that were not included in the final alignment because they are ""soft-clipped."" Soft-clipping occurs when there is insufficient overlap between the read and reference genome, resulting in these bases being discarded.

8. jI - Number of bases excluded from an alignment due to hard-clipping: This attribute counts the number of bases at either end of a read that were not included in the final alignment because they are ""hard-clipped."" Hard-clipping occurs when there is no overlap between the read and reference genome, resulting in these bases being discarded.

The ""singletons (68.37%:nan%)"" value shows that around 68.37% of the mapped reads are singletons, meaning they only have one mate mapped to a different chromosome. This could be an indication of potential structural variations or misalignments in your data.

In this case, I'd like to extract both reads.","The most efficient way would be to map to all the references at once.  You can do this with any aligner if you just concatenate the references.  Alternatively you could map to all at once using BBSplit, which can produce one fastq output file per reference, containing all the reads (or pairs) that best map to that reference.  But if you simply want all reads that map to any reference in a single fastq file, along with their unmapped mates, you can do this:pre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">1) Concatenate the references with cat.2) Map the reads with this command:bbmap.sh ref=references.fa in1=read1.fq.gz in2=read2.fq.gz outm=mapped.fq.gz outu=unmapped.fq.gz/code></pre>If one or both reads in a pair map to anything, both will go to ""outm""; if neither map, both will go to ""outu"".  The output files will be interleaved, but if you use ""outm1"" and ""outm2"" (and etc.) you can get the output in dual files."," To efficiently extract reads mapped to multiple reference sequences and handle paired-end reads, you can use a combination of tools such as BWA for alignment, SAMtools for processing, and custom scripting with Unix commands. Here is an optimized pipeline:

1. Align the reads to each reference separately using BWA (or any other suitable aligner), producing multiple SAM files. This step ensures that all references are considered individually.
2. Process each SAM file generated in step 1, extracting reads mapped to their respective reference and storing them in separate FASTQ files. You can use the `samtools fastq` command for this purpose.
3. Merge all extracted FASTQ files into a single output file using Unix commands like `cat`. This will give you a combined set of reads mapped to multiple references, including paired-end reads if they are present in any of the SAM files.
4. To handle cases where a read might be mapped to one reference without its pair, you can use additional scripting logic after step 3:
   - Sort and merge all FASTQ files using Unix commands like `sort` and `cat`. This will ensure that paired-end reads are correctly combined in the output file.
   - Use a custom script to identify unique read names across all merged FASTQ files, storing them in a text file (e.g., ""file.txt""). You can achieve this using Unix commands like `sort`, `uniq`, and `awk`.
   - Finally, extract the reads with their corresponding IDs from one of the SAM files using `grep` and store them in a new SAM file. This step ensures that all mapped reads are included in the output.

This optimized pipeline efficiently handles multiple reference mappings while also considering paired-end reads. It combines the strengths of various tools to achieve your desired outcome with minimal redundancy.",5,2.0,4

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how you can accomplish this:

```R
# Assuming 'data_t1' and 'data_t2' are data frames containing your fold change data for time points t1 and t2, respectively
library(pheatmap)

# Define the color palette with consistent colors based on fold changes
colorPalette <- c(""blue"", ""red"") # Set blue to -100 and red to +200 as desired

# Create a heat map for time point t1 (example data)
pheatmap(data_t1, 
         scale = ""none"", # Disable automatic scaling of the color bar based on fold changes
         col = colorPalette, # Use custom colors defined in 'colorPalette'
         showVarLabels = FALSE) # Hide variable labels if desired
```

In this example, we define a `colorPalette` vector with ""blue"" and ""red"", which you can adjust to match your preferred fold change ranges. Then, when creating the pheatmap object using `pheatmap()`, we set the `col` parameter to use our custom color palette. This ensures that all heat maps will have a consistent range of colors based on the values in `colorPalette`.

Remember to adjust your data frames (`data_t1`, `data_t2`) and fold change ranges accordingly, so they align with the colors you've defined in `colorPalette`.",5,1.0,5

Please do comment with any questions or issues and I'll do my best to resolve them!"," Given your background and current situation, here's an approach you can take for SNP calling using Illumina sequence reads from a highly polymorphic species:

1. Alignment with BWA: You have already aligned your reads against a reference genome using BWA. For high-polymorphism data, it is essential to choose the appropriate alignment mode and parameters. In this case, you can use `bwa mem` instead of `bwa aln`, as `mem` performs an optimized mapping that's suitable for polymorphic regions. You may also want to adjust the `-l 36` parameter (which sets the maximum number of mismatches allowed) based on your data quality and expected level of polymorphism.

2. Post-alignment processing with SAMtools: After alignment, you can use SAMtools for sorting, indexing, and extracting variants from BAM files. You may want to start by using `samtools sort` to order the aligned reads in a way that facilitates downstream variant calling. Then, create an index file with `samtools index`, which will speed up subsequent operations on your data.

3. Variant calling: For SNP calling, you can use tools like GATK's HaplotypeCaller or FreeBayes. These tools are designed to handle high-polymorphism datasets and provide more accurate variant calls compared to simpler methods. You will need to create a genotyping matrix (GT) file from your BAM files, which describes the expected allele frequencies for each position in your reference panel.

4. SNP quality assessment: To evaluate SNP quality, you can use tools like GATK's Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR), which assigns a confidence score to each variant based on its likelihood of being true or false. This step helps filter out low-quality variants and improve the accuracy of your downstream analyses.

5. Detailed documentation: For more detailed information, you can refer to GATK's user guide (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) or follow tutorials like this one from Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/v1.2.0/bioc/vignettes/SNPcalling_tutorial.html). These resources provide step-by-step instructions and explanations of the tools used in SNP calling workflows, which should help you better understand each stage of your analysis pipeline.

By following these steps and utilizing the recommended tools, you can build a robust SNP calling workflow for highly polymorphic species using Illumina sequence reads. Remember to experiment with different parameters and settings as needed based on your data quality and specific research goals. Good luck!",5,4.0,5

Key changes:
1. **Argument Parsing**: The argument parser is initialized using `argparse`. This allows you to easily parse command-line arguments for your script.
2. **Pileup Processing**: Inside the loop over pileup columns and reads, we check if there's a read alignment at each query position (`pileupread.alignment.query_name is not None`). If it's an indel (no alignment), you can report this as needed in your output format. In the example above, I used `*` to represent deletions and `-` for gaps due to insertions or other reasons; adjust these based on how you want to handle different types of indels.
3. Written with Python 2.7 syntax (as per your request), but note that it's generally recommended to use Python 3 for its improved features and support. If possible, consider updating the script to Python 3.

Remember, handling indels correctly in a pileup can be complex depending on how you want to represent them (e.g., using `*` or other characters). You may need to adjust this example based on your specific requirements for representing deletions and insertions.",4,1.0,1

However, based on your SAM output example and the error message you received from RSEM, it seems that HISAT2 is still performing gapped alignment even with `--no-spliced-alignment` and `--end-to-end` parameters. This suggests that there might be an issue with how these parameters are being interpreted or implemented by HISAT2.

To ensure that HISAT2 does not perform gapped alignment, you can try using the equivalent Bowtie2 parameters mentioned in your RSEM manual:

```bash
HISAT2 -q --dpad 0 --gbar 99999999 --mp 1,1 --np 1 --score-min L,0,-0.1
```

By using these parameters, you can mimic the behavior of Bowtie2 and potentially avoid gapped alignment with HISAT2. However, it's important to note that this approach might not guarantee complete elimination of gapped alignments as there could be other factors influencing the output.

If filtering the SAM output using `grep -v XO:i:0` does not resolve the issue, you may need to explore alternative alignment tools or consult with experts in the field for further guidance on achieving end-to-end alignments without gaps.",4,0.0,0

Is this what we mean when we say <code>alignment sensitivity</code>? What about specificity? Can we define <code>specificity</code> for alignment (not mentioned in the BWA paper)?In other words, my question is about what we <strong>really</strong> mean when we talk about sensitivity and specificity in alignments.","This is indeed a tricky question, because even the definition of ""aligned exactly and correctly"" is not that easy.If we simulated reads, than we know where they are from and how they were created, but what if (by chance) after introducing the random errors, mathematically the read maps better somewhere else? What if there are multiple mathematical best hits? <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-210"">This paper</a> has some further thoughts."," When discussing sensitivity and specificity in NGS read alignments, these terms refer to the accuracy of alignment algorithms like BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) or Bowtie2 in mapping sequencing reads against a reference genome.

Sensitivity, also known as recall or true positive rate, measures how well an algorithm can correctly identify all the reads that should be aligned to the reference genome. In other words, it quantifies the proportion of actual positives (reads from the sample) that are correctly identified by the alignment algorithm. True Positives (TP) in this context would indeed refer to the number of reads that align exactly and without any mismatches or gaps when compared to a known reference genome. False Negatives (FN), on the other hand, represent the number of reads from the sample that fail to map correctly but should have been mapped according to the true sequence in the reference genome.

Specificity, also called precision or true negative rate, measures how well an algorithm can avoid false positives â€“ i.e., it quantifies the proportion of actual negatives (reads not belonging to the sample) that are correctly identified as such by the alignment algorithm. In this context, specificity is less commonly discussed in NGS read alignments because most focus on identifying reads from a sample rather than excluding them. However, if we were to define it for alignment purposes, Specificity would be the proportion of non-mapped reads (from other genomes) that are correctly not mapped by the algorithm.

In summary, sensitivity in NGS read alignments refers to how well an algorithm can identify all true positives (correctly aligned reads), while specificity is less commonly discussed but could refer to the proportion of non-mapped reads that are correctly identified as such. These metrics help evaluate the performance and accuracy of alignment algorithms like BWA or Bowtie2 in mapping sequencing reads against a reference genome.",3,4.0,4

The command you mentioned, `samtools view -c -F 4 my.bam`, counts all reads in the entire BAM file that are not paired-end (indicated by `-F 4`) but does not limit it to a specific region.

Here's how you can modify your command to count mapped reads for a particular region, such as Chr1:0-1000:

```bash
samtools view -r Chr1:0-1000 my.bam | awk '{print $4}' | wc -l
```

Explanation of the command:

1. `samtools view -r Chr1:0-1000 my.bam`: This part filters your BAM file to only include reads that map to the specified region (in this case, ""Chr1:0-1000""). The `-r` option is used for specifying a region of interest.
2. `awk '{print $4}'`: After filtering the reads by region, we use `awk` to extract and print only the fourth field (`$4`) from each line in the output. In SAM/BAM format, this typically corresponds to the number of mapped reads for a particular alignment (the read count).
3. `| wc -l`: The pipe symbol (`|`) passes the output of `awk` as input to `wc -l`, which counts and displays the total number of lines in the output. Since each line represents one mapped read, this gives you the total number of reads that map to your specified region.

By executing this command, you will obtain the count of mapped reads for the given region (Chr1:0-1000) within your BAM file.",5,4.0,4

Here's an optimized approach using `parallel` command:

1. First, install GNU Parallel if it's not already installed on your system by running:
```bash
sudo apt-get install parallel
```

2. Then, use the following script to check for each FASTQ header in a separate BAM file using `parallel`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n ""$line"" ]]; do
    # Assuming your FASTQ headers are stored in 'fastqHeaders.txt' and the corresponding BAM files are named as 'read_<header>.bam'

                ""samtools view {} | grep $line"" ::: ""${bamFile}"" &
    fi
done < fastqHeaders.txt
```

This script reads each FASTQ header from `fastqHeaders.txt` and checks for its presence in the corresponding BAM file using `parallel`. The `--will-cite` option enables parallelism by running multiple instances of the command simultaneously, which should significantly speed up your processing time.

Note that this approach assumes you have a naming convention where each BAM file corresponds to a FASTQ header (e.g., 'read_<header>.bam'). You may need to adjust the script accordingly if your files are organized differently.",4,4.0,4
"In <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"">BWA</a>-MEM what's the best way to discriminate reads mapping uniquely from those mapping in multiple positions?The XT tags that we used in <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"">BWA</a> are no longer available.We are thinking about classifying as uniques the reads having XS:i:0 (suboptimal alignment score of 0).Someone is also suggesting to use a difference threshold between AS and XS. This would require a somewhat heavier parsing of the file, but we can do that if the improvement of results is significant. Which of the two methods is better? Are there other, better approaches?","As far as I know for a mapped read a mapping quality score of zero (column 5 in the <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf"">SAM</a> file)  is the main indicator that a read maps to multiple positions with the same score. "," Given the changes in BWA-MEM where XT tags are no longer available, discriminating between uniquely mapped reads and those mapping in multiple positions can be approached using alternative strategies. Using an alignment score (AS) threshold to differentiate between these types of alignments is one effective method. Specifically, setting a high AS threshold could help identify unique mappings, as they are likely to have higher scores due to their optimal alignment properties. However, this approach requires careful consideration of the chosen threshold value to balance sensitivity and specificity effectively.

Another strategy involves examining the XS (expected score) values for each read. In BWA-MEM's output format, a lower XS value indicates suboptimal alignment, which could be indicative of multiple mapping positions. By setting an XS threshold below a certain value (e.g., 0), you can flag reads with low scores as potentially multi-mapped. This method might require more parsing and analysis but could provide valuable insights into the nature of each read's alignment.

Between these two methods, using an AS threshold is generally simpler to implement and understand, while setting a specific XS value offers a more nuanced approach that can potentially yield better discrimination between unique and multi-mapped reads. However, it might be beneficial to experiment with both approaches or consider additional strategies, such as examining the number of alignments per read (NH tag in BWA's output) or using machine learning techniques for more sophisticated classification based on multiple features from the alignment data. Ultimately, the best approach may depend on your specific dataset and research goals.",4,4.0,3

I see little benefit in filtering improperly paired alignments, if there's are a bunch of them then they're likely correct."," The flags `-f 2` and `-F 256` used with `samtools view` command have specific meanings related to read alignment quality:

1. `-f 2`: This flag filters out reads that are not properly aligned according to the aligner's criteria. It ensures that only high-quality, well-aligned reads are retained for further analysis. While it may be considered stringent in some cases, using this flag helps ensure that you work with reliable data and reduces noise from poorly aligned or misassembled reads.

2. `-F 256`: This flag discards secondary alignments, which are alternative mappings of a read to different locations on the reference genome. Secondary alignments can arise due to various reasons such as sequencing errors, structural variations, and other complexities in genomic regions. Discarding these reads helps avoid potential issues when calling SNPs/indels using tools like freebayes.

In your case, since you are working with paired-end WGS data from yeast and E. coli for SNP/indel calling, it is reasonable to use both flags: `-f 2` ensures that only properly aligned reads are retained, while `-F 256` helps remove secondary alignments that could interfere with accurate variant detection. However, you can experiment with different combinations of these flags and others (e.g., using `-F 4`) to find the best settings for your specific dataset and analysis goals.

Remember that selecting appropriate filters is crucial in genomic data processing, as it directly impacts downstream analyses such as variant calling. It's always a good idea to consult relevant literature or seek advice from experienced researchers when determining optimal filter parameters.",4,4.0,4

I know that you can alter the SEQ field and replace exact matches with '=' using the <code>-e</code> option in samtools fillmd/calmd and that it would be relatively trivial to whip up something to do something like this manually. I've had a search around but haven't seen an example of it being used yet, though this may be due to the difficulty of searching for '=' online! Is the op '=' kept for backwards compatibility or a specific use-case? I vaguely remember someone saying on here (though I can't find a reference for it right now) that it was meant for read to genome comparisons - anyone have a reference for this?","<code>=</code> and <code>X</code> are actually the newer CIGAR operations (they were added in version 1.4 of the spec., if I remember correctly), M is the older variant. Most tools still don't produce alignments with <code>=</code> or <code>X</code> operations, though it'd be kind of nice if they did. An exception to this is BBMap (and I believe STAR can be told to produce these).There is no functionality from within samtools to modify the CIGAR string like this, though I suppose this might be nice. As is, you tend to have to parse the MD auxiliary tag if you want mismatch information, which is kind of annoying in comparison."," The '=' op in CIGAR is not specifically kept for backwards compatibility or any specific use-case, but rather serves as an alternative representation of matches within the SAM file format. While it may not be commonly used or mentioned in older papers like ""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2723002/#!po=41.6667"", its inclusion allows for flexibility and potential future extensions of the format.

In terms of functionality within samtools, there isn't a built-in option to generate an altered CIGAR that distinguishes between matches and mismatches using '=' directly. However, you can achieve similar results by utilizing the `-e` (edit) option in samtools `calmd` or `fillmd` commands. This allows for replacing exact matches with '=' in the SEQ field, which indirectly achieves a distinction between matches and mismatches.

As for distinguishing matches and mismatches using '=', there isn't an official reference that explicitly states its intended use-case. However, it is possible to interpret its purpose as providing alternative representation options within the SAM format, potentially useful in scenarios like read-to-genome comparisons or other advanced analyses where different match representations may be desired.

In summary, while '=' isn't explicitly designed for a specific use-case, it offers flexibility and potential future extensions to the SAM file format. Utilizing samtools `calmd` or `fillmd` with `-e` can achieve similar results in distinguishing matches and mismatches within CIGAR fields.",3,2.0,3

Firstly, if your original BAM file was not properly sorted or indexed before running `rmdup`, it is recommended to sort and index the resulting BAM file again using `samtools sort` and `samtools index`. This ensures that subsequent analyses will be performed on a correctly formatted .bam file.

Secondly, if you plan to perform downstream analyses or visualization tools that require sorted data (e.g., genome browsers), it is essential to sort the BAM file again after removing duplicates using `samtools sort`. This step ensures compatibility with these tools and improves performance during analysis.

Lastly, if you are working on a large dataset where memory constraints might be an issue, sorting and indexing the .bam file again can help optimize resource usage by reducing the overall size of the BAM file.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. First, install the necessary software packages if you haven't already done so. You will need both `samtools` and `fasta-splitter`. You can download them from their respective websites or use package managers like Homebrew (for macOS) or APT (for Ubuntu).

2. Once installed, open a terminal window on your computer and navigate to the directory containing your SAM file.

3. Use `samtools view` command with the `-u` option to extract unmapped reads from your SAM file:
```bash
samtools view -u input_file.sam > unmapped_reads.sam
```
This will create a new SAM file called ""unmapped_reads.sam"" containing only the unmapped reads.

4. Next, convert the extracted SAM file to FASTQ format using `fasterq-dump`:
```bash
fasterq-dump --split-files -r unmapped_reads.sam > unmapped_reads.fastq
```
This command will generate two separate FastQ files containing the forward and reverse reads, respectively (unmapped_reads_R1.fastq and unmapped_reads_R2.fastq).

Alternatively, if you prefer to have a single FASTA file with both read types:
```bash
fasterq-dump --split-files -r unmapped_reads.sam > unmapped_reads.fasta
```
This will create one FASTA file containing the forward and reverse reads (unmapped_reads.fasta).

Now, you have a separate FastQ or FASTA file with only the unmapped reads from your original SAM file. You can use these files for further analysis or experimentation as needed.",5,5.0,5

```bash
samtools mpileup -f reference.fa reads.bam > pileup_output.txt

Replace ""reference.fa"" with the path to your FASTA file, and ""reads.bam"" with the path to your BAM file. The output will be a text file (`pileup_output.txt`) containing information about each base position in the reference sequence.

2. To convert this pileup format into CSV or TSV for further manipulation, you can use `awk` and `sed`. Here's an example using `awk`:
```bash
awk 'BEGIN {FS=""\t""} /^[ACGT]/{print $1,$3}' pileup_output.txt > mutations.csv
```
This command filters out only the lines containing a nucleotide (A, C, G, or T) and prints the position (`$1`) and base call (`$3`). The output will be saved in `mutations.csv`.

 Written in paragraph format:
To compare reads in a BAM file against a FASTA reference sequence and obtain changes, you can use `samtools mpileup` to generate a pileup output file containing information about each base position in the reference sequence. Then, convert this pileup format into CSV or TSV using tools like `awk` or `sed`. For example, with `awk`, run:
```bash
awk 'BEGIN {FS=""\t""} /^[ACGT]/{print $1,$3}' pileup_output.txt > mutations.csv
```
This command filters out lines containing a nucleotide (A, C, G, or T) and prints the position (`$1`) and base call (`$3`). The output will be saved in `mutations.csv`. Alternatively, you can use `sed`:
```bash
sed -nE '/^[ACGT]/s/^([0-9]+)\t([ACTG])\t.*$/\1,\2/p' pileup_output.txt > mutations.csv

BWA MEM and SOAP2 might not find it because of its length, as shorter sequences can sometimes pose challenges for alignment algorithms. However, including extra flanking bases helped BWA MEM locate the sequence on chr8, indicating that the issue may lie in the specific parameters or settings used during the alignment process.

BWA MEM is known to be sensitive to input sequence length and quality, so it's possible that adjusting its parameters could improve results for your short sequence. On the other hand, SOAP2 might require further tuning of its options such as mismatch tolerance (-M), read depth (-r), verbosity level (-v), or memory allocation (-p) to better align with your data.

It's worth noting that BLAST and Bowtie2 found the sequence, which suggests they might be more effective at handling short sequences compared to BWA MEM and SOAP2 in this particular case. This could also indicate a potential issue with how these two aligners handle shorter reads or low-complexity regions within your input data.

In summary, it's possible that the length of your sequence is causing difficulties for some alignment tools like BWA MEM and SOAP2. However, adjusting parameters such as mismatch tolerance, read depth, verbosity level, and memory allocation might help improve results with these aligners. Additionally, considering alternative aligners or approaches may be beneficial in handling short sequences more effectively.",3,3.0,3

You have two options: mapping each individual reference genome or downloading all genomes as one and indexing them collectively. The choice depends on your computational resources and specific requirements of your project. BWA and Bowtie2 are memory-intensive tools, but they can handle large datasets with proper optimization. Indexing 400 plastid genomes together is feasible if you have sufficient memory; however, it's essential to consider the overall system load during indexing.

2. The best method depends on your specific needs and resources. If computational efficiency is a priority, mapping all reads against one collective reference genome might be more suitable. However, this approach assumes that there are no significant differences between individual genomes in terms of sequence variation or assembly quality. On the other hand, if you need to account for potential variations among plastid genomes and maintain high accuracy, mapping each individual reference genome could provide better results.

3. If you choose to map reads individually against all 400 genomes, combining BAM files might not be directly possible using tools like `bam2fastq`. However, you can use other methods such as multi-reference alignment tools (e.g., minimap2) or custom scripts that merge the aligned reads from different reference genomes based on their mapping quality scores and positions. This approach could help in generating a consolidated dataset for de novo assembly but requires careful consideration of potential biases introduced by combining multiple alignments.",3,4.0,3
"I generated and alignment using <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"">BWA</a> and the .sam file looks fine, except in my parser I'm not sure how to interpret the extended CIGAR format when the CIGAR string is simply ""*"".

Should I assume the read did not align at all? What would cause <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/"">BWA</a> to produce a CIGAR of *?",The <code>*</code> means no alignment to show.," The ""*"" character in an extended CIGAR string, as seen in your SAM file after alignment with BWA or samtools, typically signifies that no mapping was found for the read sequence. This means that the read did not align to any position within the reference genome.

In this context, when a read does not map, it is common practice to represent its CIGAR string as ""*"". It's important to note that BWA and samtools are widely used tools for alignment, and encountering such cases where reads do not align is quite normal.

The ""unavailable"" term you mentioned in the SAMtools documentation refers to situations when certain information about a read (like its CIGAR string) cannot be determined or retrieved due to various reasons like sequencing errors, low quality bases, etc. However, in your case where BWA produced a ""*"", it's more likely that this represents an unmapped read rather than ""unavailable"" data.

To handle such cases in your parser, you can check for the presence of the ""*"" character and treat those reads as not aligned or discard them based on your specific requirements.",1,1.0,5

In comparison with other popular sequence alignment tools such as NovoalignMPI, BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner), and Bowtie, SNAP offers competitive speed and accuracy.

On a 48-core machine, the SnapSeq aligner was able to complete an alignment task in approximately 22 minutes using two files of size 1.8GB each. This performance is quite impressive considering the large dataset being processed. However, it's essential to note that benchmarking results may vary depending on specific hardware configurations and software versions.

When comparing SNAP with NovoalignMPI, a parallel version of Novoalign optimized for multi-core systems, there are reports indicating that SnapSeq can outperform Novoalign in terms of speed while maintaining high accuracy levels. However, it's always recommended to conduct your own benchmark tests on the specific hardware and software versions you intend to use.

BWA is another widely used alignment tool known for its versatility and compatibility with various platforms. While BWA may not be as optimized for parallel processing as SNAP or NovoalignMPI, it still delivers good performance on multi-core systems when configured correctly. In terms of accuracy, BWA has been extensively tested and is considered reliable in the scientific community.

Bowtie, a fast and memory-efficient tool, offers excellent speed for short read alignments but may not be as suitable for larger datasets or long reads compared to SNAP and NovoalignMPI. However, Bowtie's simplicity and ease of use make it an attractive option in certain scenarios.

In summary, the SnapSeq aligner demonstrates strong performance on multi-core systems with its parallel processing capabilities. While specific benchmark results may vary depending on your hardware setup, SNAP has shown promising speed comparisons against NovoalignMPI and other alignment tools like BWA and Bowtie.

There are several factors that can contribute to this variability:

1. Randomness in the algorithm: Although BWA uses deterministic algorithms for most of its steps, there may be some random components involved in certain processes such as seed selection or gap extension during alignment. These small variations could lead to different alignments between runs with identical parameters and input data.

2. Multi-threading effects: BWA's multi-threaded implementation can introduce variability due to the non-deterministic nature of thread scheduling, memory access patterns, or other factors related to parallel processing. This could potentially lead to different alignments between runs when using multiple threads.

3. Read quality variations: Low read quality in certain regions may affect alignment accuracy and consistency across runs. If the input reads have varying quality scores, it can result in different alignments due to BWA's sensitivity to low-quality bases during the alignment process. It is recommended to filter out or downsample reads with poor quality before performing multiple alignments to minimize this effect.

4. Seed selection: During the initial steps of the alignment, BWA selects seeds for each read based on certain criteria such as k-mer matching and Hamming distance. Small variations in seed selection can lead to different alignments between runs with identical input data.

To minimize these sources of variability, it is recommended to perform multiple alignments using the same parameters and inputs while ensuring that all other factors (e.g., read quality) are consistent across runs. Additionally, you may want to investigate further by comparing your BAM files' alignment statistics or performing a more detailed analysis on regions with low-quality reads to better understand any potential impacts on alignment consistency.",3,3.0,3

In cases where the most probable transition is 'm-&gt;d' or 'd-&gt;d', a dot (.) should be inserted in the consensus sequence to represent an amino acid gap. This indicates that there was no match for that particular position, and it helps maintain the alignment of the protein sequences.

For transitions such as 'd-&gt;' or 'm-&gt;i', a dash (-) can be used in the consensus sequence to represent an amino acid gap if there is no match at that position.

The flag 117 indicates that this particular row contains paired-end reads, where one of the pairs is properly mapped while the other pair consists of an unmapped read and a reverse strand read.

In more detail, when you have paired-end data, each read in a pair should ideally be aligned to the reference genome on both ends (forward and reverse). However, there can be instances where one or both reads do not align properly due to various factors like sequencing errors, low quality bases, repetitive regions, or other alignment challenges.

The unmapped read in this case could have failed to map because it does not have a corresponding mate (the reverse strand read), which might be aligned correctly on the reference genome. This situation can occur when there is an issue with one of the reads, such as low quality or ambiguous mapping, and its pair has successfully mapped.

In summary, flag 117 indicates that you have paired-end data where one read in a pair is properly aligned (aligned to reference strand), while another pair consists of an unmapped read and a reverse strand read.

To address this problem, you may consider the following workaround:

1. Verify your input parameters and ensure that they are correctly specified for your specific dataset. Double-check the values used in `bwa aln` and make sure they align with the requirements of your SOLiD data.

2. Try using a different alignment tool or adjusting the `-q` parameter value to see if it resolves the inconsistency issue. You can experiment with lower quality scores (e.g., -q 10) and observe whether this change improves the output.

However, generally speaking, aligners tend to scale with the number of bases rather than reads when it comes to run time. This is because the alignment process involves mapping each read (sequence) against a large reference genome, and having more bases in an individual file allows for longer sequences to be aligned within that single file, potentially reducing overhead from opening multiple files or handling smaller sequence lengths.

For aligners like BWA, which are designed with memory efficiency in mind, splitting FASTQ files based on the number of bases can lead to better utilization of available RAM during alignment, especially for large datasets and when dealing with reads of varying lengths. This approach also allows for more uniform distribution of computational load across multiple processing units if you're using a parallel computing environment.

BFAST and stampy are less memory-intensive but still benefit from larger base counts per file due to the same reasons mentioned above. However, it is essential to consider that extremely large files may pose challenges in terms of I/O operations and system resource limitations. In such cases, a hybrid approach might be more effective: splitting reads into manageable sizes while ensuring each chunk still contains enough bases for meaningful alignment.

In summary, aligners generally scale better with the number of bases per file due to improved memory usage and reduced overhead from handling smaller sequence lengths. However, it's crucial to consider system limitations and choose an approach that balances computational efficiency with practical constraints when dealing with large datasets and varying read lengths.",3,4.0,4

I am adding the solution here just in case others run into this issue too."," The issue you are facing with zero alignments using BWA could be due to several reasons. Here are some steps and considerations that might help resolve your problem:

1. Check input file quality: Ensure that the SOLiD reads from your fastq file have good quality scores, as low-quality reads may not align well or at all with BWA. You can use tools like FastQC to assess the quality of your reads.

2. Adjust parameters for bwa and samse: The default settings for bwa (BWA) and samse might not be optimal for SOLiD data, which is a sequencing technology that generates colored output. You may need to adjust some parameters like -n, -t, or the reference genome index format (-c). Experiment with different parameter values to find the best settings for your dataset.

3. Use color space indices: Since SOLiD data uses colorspace encoding, you should use a bwa-color package (e.g., bwacolorspace) or create a custom index using tools like sambamba that support colored output. This will help BWA to properly align the reads with their corresponding color barcodes.

4. Check reference genome: Ensure that you are using an appropriate and up-to-date reference genome for your alignment, such as hg19 or a more recent version like GRCh38. You can download these genomes from sources like UCSC Genome Browser.

5. Use alternative aligners: BWA is not specifically designed to handle colored SOLiD data; however, there are other tools that might work better for this purpose, such as bwa-mem or minimap2 with a custom index format (e.g., using sambamba). You can try these alternatives and compare their performance against your current setup.

6. Check alignment output: After running the samse command, check the output SAM/BAM files for any potential issues like incorrect read names or color barcodes. This could help identify if there are specific reads that aren't aligning correctly.

7. Consult documentation and community resources: Review BWA's official documentation to ensure you have used all available options, parameters, and flags appropriately. Additionally, consider reaching out to the bioinformatics community through forums or mailing lists to discuss your specific issue with SOLiD data alignment using BWA.

By addressing these points, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the zero alignments problem in your SOLiD reads using bwa and samse.",5,3.0,1

To overcome this issue, consider the following approaches:

1. Profile definition: Ensure that your HMM profile is accurately representing the domain of interest by carefully examining its sequence alignment and considering any gaps or insertions in the model. You may need to adjust the initial states (I) and acceptor states (A) within the HMM profile, as well as the gap penalties, to better match the UniProt results.

2. Search parameters: Experiment with different search parameters such as E-value threshold, sequence length cutoff, and domain coverage percentage. Adjusting these values may help you obtain a more accurate result that aligns with your expectations from UniProt.

3. Multiple searches: Perform multiple HMMER searches using various profiles or settings to increase the likelihood of identifying domains consistent with those reported by UniProt. This approach can also help identify any potential biases in a single search result.

4. Combining results: Consider combining your HMMER search results with other domain prediction tools, such as Pfam or InterProScan, to validate and refine the identified domains. By using multiple sources of evidence, you may be able to reconcile discrepancies between UniProt and HMMER results more effectively.

5. Sequence context: Ensure that your input sequences are properly aligned with their respective domain boundaries in mind. Misalignments or incorrect sequence handling could lead to unexpected search outcomes.

By carefully examining the profile definition, adjusting search parameters, performing multiple searches, and combining results from different sources, you should be able to improve the accuracy of HMMER's domain identification process and achieve more consistent results with UniProt databases.",3,3.0,3

For all the seed length parameter is important to increase sensitivity."," When aligning your miRNA reads against a reference genome using BWA, it's essential to consider parameters and tools specifically optimized for short sequences like miRNAs. The discrepancy you observed between BWA and Novoalign could indeed suggest that certain settings or algorithms are better suited for miRNA alignment.

BWA has several modes (e.g., `bwa mem`, `bwa sampe`), but the default parameters might not be optimal for short reads, particularly those as small as miRNAs. The `-l 30` option in BWA allows for up to 30 mismatches during alignment, which could lead to a high number of unaligned reads if your sequences have low similarity to the reference genome or contain many unique regions.

Considering this, you might want to experiment with different BWA parameters that are more lenient towards mismatches and gaps, such as using `-l 30` for `bwa sampe`, which is designed for paired-end reads but can be adapted for single-end miRNA data. Additionally, adjusting the seed length (`-M`) to a higher value might improve alignment of short sequences by allowing BWA to consider more mismatches in the initial alignment phase.

Another approach could involve using specialized tools designed for highly accurate and sensitive alignment of small RNAs against reference genomes. Tools like STAR or HISAT2 are specifically optimized for next-generation sequencing data, including miRNA sequences. These aligners can handle short reads more efficiently by incorporating seed-based alignment strategies that focus on the most promising regions in the genome to reduce computational time and improve accuracy.

For instance, using HISAT2 with its `-p` option allows you to specify a custom reference index (which could be tailored for miRNA sequences if available), potentially improving alignment performance. Additionally, adjusting parameters like seed length (`-k`) can help in aligning short reads more accurately by focusing on the most relevant regions of the genome.

In summary, while BWA is a powerful tool for sequence alignment, exploring alternative tools and parameter settings specifically tailored for miRNA sequences might yield better results. Experimentation with different parameters or switching to specialized aligners like HISAT2 could significantly improve your alignment success rate, especially considering the unique characteristics of miRNA data.",3,2.0,4
"Hi,BWA usually reports one  line for each read even when the read don't mapped the reference sequence.There are some way to print in the sam file only the alignment when the read are aligned with the reference sequence?Thanks in advanceCris  ","samtools view -F 4 your.bamThis is directly from the manual of Samtools.  I recommend reading all the options.  It tried to avoid it, but really knowing Samtools is worth the time!"," Yes, BWA can be configured to report alignments only for reads that map successfully to the reference genome. This is achieved by using the `-a` or `--sam-output` option when running BWA. By default, BWA outputs all reads regardless of their mapping status. However, with the `-a` option, you can specify a file where only aligned (mapped) reads are written to.

Here's an example command that uses BWA in SAM format and includes the `-a` option:

```bash
bwa mem -M reference_genome.fasta input_reads.fastq | samtools view -Sha > aligned_output.sam
```

In this example, `reference_genome.fasta` is your genome file and `input_reads.fastq` contains the sequencing reads you want to align. The `-M` option in BWA enables multi-mapping mode, which allows a read to be mapped at multiple locations on the reference genome.

After running this command, the output will contain only aligned (mapped) reads and their corresponding SAM format records. You can then use `samtools view -Sha` or other tools like `samtools sort`, `samtools index`, etc., to further process your SAM file as needed.",4,4.0,1
"I'm using bwa to align reads, and I have to choose the indexing method to use.  The documentation says to use <code>-a is</code> for small genomes, and <code>-a bwtsw</code> for large genomes.  I've used <code>is</code>, but sometimes this will crash with a segmentation fault, and <code>bwtsw</code> seems to work.  Surely there is a better way to decide this than by trial and error?  At what size is a genome ""large"", meaning I should use <code>bwtsw</code>?  What is really the difference here?","From <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml"">BWA</a> manualpre><code> IS     is moderately fast, but does not work with database larger than 2GB./code></pre>blockquote>  bwtsw Algorithm implemented in BWT-SW. This method works with the whole human genome, but it does not work with database smaller than 10MB and it is usually slower than IS./blockquote>"," The choice between `-a is` (Indexed Sequence) and `-a bwtsw` (BWA-SW algorithm for large genomes) depends on your specific genome size, but there are general guidelines you can follow to avoid trial and error. BWA's documentation suggests using `-a is` for small genomes, typically those under 10 million base pairs (bp), while `-a bwtsw` is recommended for larger genomes, usually over 10 million bp. However, these are not strict thresholds, and the optimal choice can depend on your specific dataset and computational resources.

The key difference between these two methods lies in their indexing approach: `is` uses a simple index that allows fast alignment but may struggle with larger genomes due to memory constraints or slower performance; whereas `bwtsw` employs an advanced indexing strategy designed for large-scale sequencing projects, offering improved speed and efficiency at the cost of increased computational resources.

To make an informed decision without resorting to trial and error, consider your genome size and available computational resources. If you're working with a smaller genome (<10 million bp), `-a is` should suffice. However, if you're dealing with larger genomes or require faster processing times despite higher memory usage, `-a bwtsw` might be the better choice.

It's also worth noting that BWA provides a comprehensive set of options and parameters to fine-tune your alignment process based on specific requirements. Therefore, if you encounter segmentation fault issues with `is`, it could be due to limitations in handling large genomes or memory constraints rather than an inherent flaw in the algorithm itself. In such cases, optimizing your computational environment (e.g., increasing available RAM) or adjusting BWA's parameters might help mitigate these issues.

In summary, while there are general guidelines based on genome size for choosing between `-a is` and `-a bwtsw`, the optimal choice ultimately depends on your specific dataset characteristics and computational resources. Experimentation within reasonable limits can guide you towards the most efficient alignment method for your needs.",3,3.0,4

This was fine for making the dbsnp reference but is probably not ideal for general use cases. I will make the identifier requirement optional and maybe add a few more options (like skipping sites that fail filters and some things described in the next point) shortly.(2) <strong>Refs based on sample genotypes</strong>What you said (hs37lite.fa as the primary, output of joinx create-contigs as the alternate) is how we do it. Right now, joinx doesn't look at the genotype data; contigs are created for every alternate allele in the ALT field for each site in the vcf file (whether or not the variants appear in a GT call). I will add some options to do things like only process alleles that are present in GT calls, and maybe allow some basic filtering based on INFO/FORMAT fields (e.g., DP &gt; 20). In any case, I don't think you need to worry about phasing in the vcf sample data (GT=1/2 vs GT=1|2); you will get both sequences created either way.(3) <strong>Variant calling pipeline</strong>I wouldn't change what you're doing right away. I would suggest running things through your existing pipeline to see how the results vary. Most of the testing I have done personally has just used samtools for variant calling after aligning with ibwa (not necessarily because I feel like that is the best thing to do). If you are wanting to generate sequences from existing sample data in a vcf, then I would definitely not suggest simplifying your existing calling strategy for generating the initial set of variants as you will want your alternate hypotheses to be as accurate as possible.(4) <strong>Optimizations</strong>Any pre-processing that works for bwa (trimming, filtering) should work the same for ibwa. The only differences between ibwa and stock bwa 0.5.9 are in sampe, so any methods that speed up ""bwa aln"" that yield equivalent .sai files are applicable (pbwa might be an option here). GobyBWA looks like it has its own file formats, so that will not work well. Lastly, ibwa sampe does have a -t option to support multi-threading. There have been some other sampe threading patches to bwa that work a bit better (at the expense of using more memory) than what I did in ibwa, but the -t option is worth trying if you become angry about the wall clock time used by ibwa sampe."," iBWA is indeed an excellent tool for variant discovery and genotyping using paired-end reads. For creating custom reference or remap files from VCFs, you can use tools like bcftools or custom scripts written in Python (e.g., using the PyVCF library). These tools allow you to manipulate VCF data effectively.

When it comes to using custom references based on sample genotypes, there are different strategies you could consider. Using a primary reference file such as hs37lite.fa and including additional observed alleles similar to dbSNP137 is one approach. However, phasing the data to obtain two alternate haplotype references might be more accurate in some cases, especially when dealing with complex genomic regions or populations with high genetic diversity.

Regarding your variant calling pipeline using iBWA, it's possible to drop GATK and indel realignment steps if you are confident that the input data quality is sufficient for alignment accuracy. However, keep in mind that this might affect downstream analyses like variant calling or genotyping. Samtools can be used as an alternative aligner, but it may not have all the features of iBWA.

To improve iBWA alignment accuracy, you could consider using tools such as FastQC for quality control and filtering before alignment (e.g., trimming low-quality bases). Additionally, pBWA is a parallelized version of BWA that can speed up alignments on multi-core systems. As for reducing bam size with gobiBWA, you could consider using tools like SAMtools or Picard to remove duplicate reads and compress the resulting bam file.

In summary, there are various options available when working with iBWA, including custom reference files, alternative aligners, and post-processing steps for improving alignment accuracy and speed. It's essential to evaluate your specific use case and data quality before deciding on a particular approach.",3,4.0,4

When you run `samtools tview`, it outputs several columns representing different attributes of the alignments in your BAM file.

Here's a breakdown of some common characters and their meanings:

1. `.`: This represents missing data or unknown values for that particular attribute. For example, if an alignment has no reference sequence (RNAME) associated with it, you will see a dot instead of the RNAME value in the output. Similarly, other attributes like QNAME, FLAG, MAPQ, etc., can also have dots when they are missing or unknown for that specific read.

2. `,`: This character is used to separate columns and values within each row. It helps you distinguish between different fields in the output table. For instance, if there's a comma separating two numbers, it means those numbers belong to different attributes of an alignment (e.g., QNAME and RNAME).

3. `.` underlined: This is used for formatting purposes within the `samtools tview` command. It helps highlight specific columns or values in the output table by making them stand out with a dotted border, which can make it easier to identify important information quickly.

To better understand the meaning of each column and attribute displayed by `samtools tview`, you can refer to the SAM/BAM specification documentation provided by the developers at UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz). The document explains all attributes, their meanings, and how they are represented in the output.

Here's a brief summary of some common columns:

- QNAME: Query template name (read identifier)
- FLAG: Bitwise flags indicating various alignment properties
- RNAME: Reference sequence name to which the read aligns
- POS: 1-based leftmost mapping position
- MAPQ: Phred quality score of the best alignment for this read
- CIGAR: Alignment format string describing how well the read aligns to the reference
- RNEXT: Reference sequence name of the next mate (if any)
- PNEXT: 1-based leftmost mapping position of the next mate (if any)
- TLEN: Length of the read, including soft clipped bases
- SEQ: Read sequence
- QUAL: Base quality scores for each base in the alignment

1. Combine all your BAM files into one file using `samtools merge`. This will create a single merged BAM file containing the data from all individual files. You can do this by running:

```bash
samtools merge combined_file.bam *.bam
```

2. Use `samtools view` to extract reads mapped on ""chr1"" and save them into another output file, leaving out other chromosomes. Run the following command:

```bash
samtools view -f SAM chr1 combined_file.bam > chr1_reads.bam
```

This will create a new BAM file called `chr1_reads.bam` containing only reads mapped on ""chr1"".

3. If you want to remove the ""chr1"" data from your original merged BAM file, simply delete or move the `chr1_reads.bam` file and use it as a reference for further analysis:

```bash
rm chr1_reads.bam # Remove the extracted BAM file if not needed anymore
```

As such, these tags are no longer reliable indicators in the alignment output.

Regarding assigning a quality score of 0 to multiple hits, this practice was indeed common in earlier aligners like BWA-SEQ and SAMtools. However, it's essential to verify current practices as they may have evolved with newer versions or alternative tools. The most up-to-date information can typically be found on the official documentation of the alignment tool you are using (e.g., BWA mem's website) or in recent publications and user manuals related to genome sequencing analysis.

To determine if a read is uniquely mapped from BWA-mem alignment, one approach could involve examining the SAM/BAM file generated by the aligner. A uniquely mapped read should have an 'N' (indicating no match) in its CIGAR string for any positions that are not part of the reference sequence. However, it is essential to note that this method might not be foolproof due to potential alignment ambiguities or other factors affecting mapping quality.

In summary, while XT and XA tags were once used by BWA-SEQ/SAMtools for indicating multi-mapping reads, their usage has been deprecated in newer versions like BWA mem. Assigning a quality score of 0 to multiple hits was common practice but may have evolved over time. To determine uniquely mapped reads from BWA-mem alignment, examining the CIGAR string and reference mapping status can provide some insights, although it might not be entirely conclusive due to potential complexities in read mapping.",3,2.0,2
"Can anyone, in a simple, explicit way, point out the trick which improve aligning speed/efficiency by burrow-wheeler transform (BWA/Bowtie compared to MAQ)?I read the paper about MAQ,BWA,Bowtie, and also review, but only become more confused. What's the trick here?thx","Let's consider exact matching and inexact matching separately.For the exact matching problem, it is true that BWT-based algorithms are faster. Suppose we have a read of length ""l"" (letter ell, not one) and a genome of length ""L"". If we use a naive k-mer hash table, each k-mer appears L/4^k times. Thus the time complexity is O(l*L/4^k). For human, L=3e9 and typically k=13. L/4^k is about ~50, which is not a small number already. In practice, a hash-table based method does even worse because the human genome is much more repetitive than a random string. A lot of k-mer have thousands of occurrences. Visiting each of them is quite slow. In contrast, with BWT (more exactly FM-Index), we can always tell if the read has a perfect match in O(l) time, no matter how long or how repetitive the genome is. Essentially, FM-index collapses all the copies of a substring. We simultaneously align a sequence to all copies, rather than align to each copy like what we do with a hash table. This is why BWT-based algorithms are faster.On the other hand, I do not think BWT-based algorithms are faster for inexact matching problem. For inexact matching, we may still need to visit multiple copies similar to the read sequence. Although with BWT we still do better than with a hash table in theory, as each BWT operation is more expensive, the advantage of BWT is reduced. Moreover, for longer short reads, we can start to use multiple seeds, which may greatly boost the performance of hash table based algorithms. In fact, for 100bp reads, several hash table based mappers compete BWT-based ones on speed.Most of us get the impression that BWT-based algorithms are faster because for 30bp reads they were by far faster than the first-generation hash-based short-read mappers such as SOAP1 and MAQ. This is not necessarily true nowadays. In addition, we may misbelieve BWT-based ones are faster because they are popular, but this may be more related to the fact they are relatively well developed (e.g. user friendliness, memory and even reputation), instead of speed. Another fact we frequently overlook is that the most accurate short-read mappers are still based on hash tables. For BWT-based methods, differentiating subtle hits dramatically increases the computing time. It is very difficult to get an extreme accuracy while maintaining a reasonable speed."," The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is an algorithm that rearranges characters in a string to create a transformed version with better compression efficiency. BWA and Bowtie utilize this transform along with FM-index, which improves alignment speed and efficiency compared to MAQ's approach.

The key trick lies in the way BWT and FM-index handle data: instead of searching through all possible alignments (as in MAQ), they create a compressed index that allows for faster pattern matching. This is achieved by breaking down the input sequence into smaller, more manageable pieces called ""rotations"" and then sorting these rotations lexicographically. The transformed string generated from this process contains information about the original data's structure, enabling efficient searching using a binary search algorithm.

BWA uses BWT to create an FM-index of both the query (read) and reference sequences. This index allows for fast alignment by performing pattern matching on the rotated version of the query sequence against the compressed representation of the reference sequence. Bowtie, on the other hand, employs a similar approach but with some optimizations in its implementation to further improve speed and efficiency.

In summary, BWA and Bowtie's use of BWT and FM-index allows for faster alignment by efficiently searching through compressed data instead of brute-forcing all possible alignments like MAQ does. This approach significantly improves the performance in terms of both speed and memory usage when dealing with large genomic datasets.",3,4.0,4
"Dear Members,Is there a way I can removes reads associated with a region (chr, start, end) from a .bam file (RNASeq data) prior to the application of HTSeq?I will greatly appreciate your feedbackNoushin","<pre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">bedtools intersect -abam file.bam -b filter.bed -v &gt; filtered.bam/code></pre>filter.bed should containpre class=""pre""><code class=""language-bash"">chr    start     end/code></pre>"," Yes, it is possible to remove reads associated with a specific genomic region from a BAM file before applying HTSeq for RNA-seq analysis. One way to achieve this is by using tools like SAMtools and bamCutter. Firstly, you can use SAMtools to extract the reads that fall within your specified chromosome (chr), start, and end positions into a new BAM file. This process involves filtering out unwanted reads based on their genomic coordinates.

Here is an example of how you could accomplish this using command-line tools:

1. Extract the desired region from the original BAM file:
```bash
samtools view -bS input.bam chrY 100000-200000 > output_region.bam
```
In this example, replace `input.bam` with your actual BAM file name and specify the chromosome (`chrY`), start position (100,000), and end position (200,000) according to your needs. The resulting output will be a new BAM file containing only reads within the specified region.

2. Once you have extracted the desired region into a separate BAM file, you can proceed with applying HTSeq for downstream analysis on this filtered data set.

By following these steps, you should be able to remove reads associated with your specific genomic region from an RNASeq .bam file before using HTSeq or any other tools in the analysis pipeline.",4,4.0,4
"Hello, I've noticed that bwa mem outputs results to be inconsistent under following setting.  I'd have expected this to be not the case, and would appreciate if someone can comment on why this is happening. I have tested this with both bwa mem v0.7.5 and 0.7.15.Steps to reproduce:1. Create multiple FASTQ paired-end files from a reference FASTQ set of files. So, if there are 10000 read in our reference FASTQ files (s1.fastq, and s2.fastq), I generate another set of fastq files which also have the same 10000 reads but in a different order.

The newly generated shuffled files are reorder1.fastq, reorder2.fastq.  I made sure reorder1.fastq has all the entries in s1.fastq (and the same for reorder2.fastq/s2.fastq) using this:pre><code class=""lang-py"">#!/usr/bin/env pythonimport Bioimport Bio.SeqIOimport sysfile1 = sys.argv[1]file2 = sys.argv[2]results = []records = {}for s in Bio.SeqIO.parse(file1,""fastq""):    records[s.id] = sfor s in Bio.SeqIO.parse(file2,""fastq""):    if not records[s.id].seq == s.seq:        results.append(s)print ""Unmatched records"", len(results)/code></pre>2.

The first is caused by the insert size estimate. Different batches of reads have slightly different insert size distribution, which affects paired-end alignment. You can in principle feed the insert size distribution to bwa-mem, but the bwa-mem estimate is usually better than a naive estimate and is at least more convenient.The second source is the ""random"" placement of repetitive hits. Bwa-mem is not really using a random number generator. It instead hashes deterministic information, such that the i-th read in the input is always associated with the same hash and has the same mapping. Reordering obviously breaks the deterministic behavior. I later learned that Bowtie2 hashes read names instead of the index of read. That is usually a better strategy except when you change read names."," The inconsistency you are observing in BWA mem output could be due to several reasons:

1. Sequence Order Variation: When generating shuffled FASTQ files, it's possible that the order of sequences within each file is not randomized uniformly across all pairs. This can lead to different alignments as BWA mem may encounter reads in a different sequence context than expected based on their original positions in the reference genome.

2. Sequence Quality: The quality scores associated with each read might have been affected during the shuffling process, leading to inconsistent alignment results. It's essential to ensure that the generated FASTQ files maintain the same sequence and quality information as the original ones.

3. BWA Mem Parameters: Although you mentioned using different versions of BWA mem (v0.7.5 and 0.7.15), it is still worth checking if there are any differences in alignment parameters or settings between these versions that could contribute to inconsistent results. You can try running the same experiment with a single version of BWA mem for more consistent comparisons.

Samtools has the options of sorting alignments by read name or by chromosomal coordinate. Why would someone choose one over the other? What are some practical aspects to consider for each sorting method for downstream applications (e.g. counting the number of hits vs. the reference genome).,"Many programs require bam files to be sorted by coordinates; this can save memory when doing specific operations like variant-calling and coverage calculation.  Also, programs like IGV need sorted, indexed bam files so that when you display a certain genomic area, they can rapidly access and display the relevant reads.Name-sorting is useful when doing operations that require reads to be paired.  Sam files often break interleaved pairing order, and coordinate-sorted bam files always do.  With a coordinate-sorted bam, it can take a lot of time and memory to restore the original fastq read order (the original fastq cannot typically be fully restored).  Name-sorting the file makes restoring pairing trivial, since the original reads are adjacent.So - some downstream programs require a sorted, indexed bam.  For those programs, that's what you need to provide.  But when programs are capable of handling unsorted sam output, I suggest using a gzipped sam file with reads in the original order, which makes recovery or remapping of the original data much easier (aside from the inherent lossiness of the sam format, which will discard the original names), and generally makes pipelines faster compared to using bam files as an intermediate stage.Note that as of samtools 1.4, the bam format is much faster and may be competitive with gzipped sam files, depending on the situation."," When choosing between sorting alignments by read name or chromosomal coordinate using Samtools, one must consider the specific requirements and objectives of their downstream analysis. Sorting by read name is particularly useful when the primary interest lies in tracking individual reads across samples or conditions. This approach facilitates easy identification of duplicates (reads mapping to multiple locations), which can be crucial for variant calling accuracy as it helps eliminate potential errors arising from multi-mapping reads. Additionally, sorting by read name supports straightforward downstream analyses that require the aggregation of data based on individual samples or experiments, such as differential expression analysis in RNA-seq studies.

On the other hand, sorting alignments by chromosomal coordinate is advantageous when focusing on genomic features and their distribution across a reference genome. This method allows for efficient identification of regions with high read density (e.g., peaks in ChIP-seq data) or areas with significant variation (e.g., SNPs, indels). Sorting by chromosomal coordinate is also beneficial when conducting comparative genomic analyses across multiple samples or species, as it enables straightforward visualization and comparison of alignments within the context of a reference genome's structure.

In summary, the choice between sorting methods depends on whether the analysis requires tracking individual reads (read name) or focusing on genomic features and their distribution (chromosomal coordinate). Both approaches have practical implications for downstream applications such as variant calling accuracy, sample aggregation, peak identification in ChIP-seq data, and comparative genomics analyses.",3,4.0,4
"Does anyone know what the <code>MAPQ</code> values produced by <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/""><code>BWA-MEM</code></a> mean?

Note that this is different than the <code>BWA</code> <code>MAPQ</code> scoring interpretation, because <code>BWA-MEM</code> gives <code>MAPQ</code> scores in the range [0,60], rather than [0,37] as has <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.acgt.me/blog/2014/12/16/understanding-mapq-scores-in-sam-files-does-37-42"">been established for <code>BWA</code></a>.","MAPQ scores are not meaningful because BAM is not meaningful - or rather, the field has yet to define the difference between read-alignments (what BAM officially stores) and fragment-alignments (what most aligners produce).The issue goes far deeper than MAPQ scores, but if you want to read about MAPQ this is a good resource:a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/mapq-values-are-really-useful-but-their-implementation-is-a-mess/"">https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/mapq-values-are-really-useful-but-their-implementation-is-a-mess/</a>But attempting to create a common standard is impossible. People want different things out of the MAPQ score, and so there can not be a single standard. Some people want it to represent how well the alignment aligns, others how well the fragment in it's entirety aligns, others a combination of both, sometimes with and sometimes without taking into account how many other possible alignments there might be for the read/fragment. It's a mess, and it all stems from the fact that pretty much every aligner produces non-standard BAMs except BWA, which produces BAMs no one would use if they needed to store more than one alignment per sequencing event."," The MAPQ (mapping quality) values produced by BWA-MEM are used to indicate the reliability of each alignment generated during the process of aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome. These scores range from 0 to 60, with higher numbers indicating greater confidence in the alignment's accuracy. The interpretation of MAPQ values is as follows:

- A MAPQ value of 0 indicates that the read maps to five or more locations on the reference genome, suggesting a low quality alignment and potential for multiple mapping possibilities. This could be due to repetitive regions in the genome or poor sequencing data quality.
  
- A MAPQ value between 1 and 3 represents an intermediate level of confidence in the alignment. Specifically:
    - A score of 1 indicates that the read maps to three locations, suggesting a possible ambiguous mapping situation.
    - A score of 2 indicates that the read maps to two locations, which may also suggest potential for alternative alignments or sequencing errors.
  
- A MAPQ value of 60 represents a unique and highly reliable alignment with no other plausible mappings on the reference genome. This is considered as an excellent mapping quality score.

It's important to note that these interpretations are based on general guidelines, and different aligners may have their own specific implementations for MAPQ scoring. The theoretical relationship between MAPQ values and alignment probability (10^(-MAPQ/10)) is not directly applicable in this case due to the difference in score ranges compared to other tools like BWA.",2,2.0,2
"I have two fastq files.  I want to use bwa to produce two sam files as this is more efficent for me than merging the fastq files and running bwa on the bigger file.  If I run bwa separately on the fastq files and merge the sam files later, will the result be different?  (I don't know if this is an important detail, but I know a priori that the fastq files have reads from separate chromosomes.)","Individual reads are mapped independently of each other. So mapping the reads in two chunks should produce the same mappings as a single file. However, I wouldn't expect mapping runs to always be identical as there is a random element to mapping repetitive hits."," Running BWA separately on two distinct FASTQ files and then merging the resulting SAM files can indeed yield different results compared to running BWA on a combined FASTQ file, especially when dealing with reads originating from separate chromosomes. This discrepancy arises primarily due to how alignment is handled in each scenario.

When you run BWA separately on two distinct FASTQ files (each representing different chromosomes), the tool aligns reads independently for each file, which means that it considers only the genomic context of those specific chromosomes during alignment. This approach ensures accurate mapping and preserves the integrity of data from separate chromosomes but may lead to disjointed results when merging SAM files later on.

On the other hand, running BWA on a combined FASTQ file (where reads are concatenated) aligns all reads as if they originate from a single reference genome. This method can be more efficient computationally and may provide a unified view of the alignment across different chromosomes; however, it risks introducing misalignments or inaccuracies due to the complex genomic context when dealing with reads from separate chromosomes.

Therefore, if you have distinct chromosomal data within your FASTQ files and wish to maintain their integrity during alignment, running BWA separately on each file is advisable. However, be aware that merging SAM files later may require additional steps (e.g., sorting or indexing) to ensure a coherent final output. This approach prioritizes the accuracy of chromosomal data representation over computational efficiency but aligns with your specific requirement for handling reads from separate chromosomes effectively.",3,4.0,4
"Hi,I'm looking for a nice way to calculate the percentage of reads on specifique chromosomes (MT und (1-23,X,Y) und unplaced scaffold).I know I can get the read counts per chromosome with <code>samtools idxstats</code>, however I have a lot of bam files and I would like to automate the calculation. The problem is, I'm struggling with basic batch text maniplulation and would therefore appreciate any help you can give me (specific or general).Edit: I forgot to mention, that I have multiple bam files, which are indexed and only consist of uniquely mapped reads.","I'd suggest to also having a look at <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth"">mosdepth</a> and <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://github.com/brentp/goleft/tree/master/indexcov"">indexcov</a>."," To calculate the percentage of reads on specific chromosomes across multiple BAM files, you can use a combination of `samtools`, shell scripting for batch processing, and basic text manipulation techniques. Here's a step-by-step guide to automate this process:

1. **List all your BAM files**: First, list all the indexed BAM files in your directory using the `ls` command or any other method that suits you. For example, if your BAM files are named as ""sample_1.bam"", ""sample_2.bam"", etc., you can use a simple loop to iterate through them:

```bash
for file in *.bam; do
  # Process each file here
done
```

2. **Calculate read counts per chromosome**: Use `samtools idxstats` for each BAM file, and redirect the output to a text file or directly process it within your script. You can use `awk`, `sed`, or other text manipulation tools to extract the desired information from the output of `samtools idxstats`.

```bash
for file in *.bam; do
  samtools idxstats ""$file"" > ""${file}.counts.txt""
done
```

3. **Process each BAM file's read counts**: Now, you can process the generated count files to calculate the percentage of reads on specific chromosomes (MT, and chromosomes 1-23, X, Y). You will need a script that reads these count files, extracts relevant information using text manipulation tools like `awk`, and calculates percentages.

Here's an example bash script to calculate the percentage of reads on specific chromosomes for one BAM file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file=""$1"" # Pass your BAM file as an argument when running this script
output_file=""${file}.percentages.txt""

awk 'BEGIN {
  MT=""MT""; X=""X""; Y=""Y""; chromosomes=(""MT"" ""1"" ""2"" ""3"" ... ""23"" ""X"" ""Y"");
}
{
  for (i = 1; i <= length(chromosomes); i++) {
    if ($1 == chromosomes[i]) {
      counts[$1] += $3; # Sum up read counts per chromosome
    }
  }
}' ""$file"".counts.txt > ""${output_file}""

# Calculate percentages and write to output file
awk 'BEGIN {
  total=0;
}
{
  for (i = 1; i <= length(chromosomes); i++) {
    if ($1 == chromosomes[i]) {
      counts[$1] += $3; # Sum up read counts per chromosome
      total+=($3); # Calculate total reads across all chromosomes
    }
  }
}
END {
  for (i = 1; i <= length(chromosomes); i++) {
    if ($1 == chromosomes[i]) {
      percentage=((counts[$1]/total)*100); # Calculate percentage per chromosome
      print $1, ""%"", percentage; # Print the result
    }
  }
}' ""${output_file}"" > ""${output_file}.percentages""
```

4. **Combine results**: Finally, you can combine the calculated percentages from all BAM files into a single output file using `awk` or any other text processing tool that suits your needs. Here's an example of how to do this with the previous script and assuming all processed count files are in the same directory:

```bash
for file in *.bam; do
  ./your_script.sh ""$file"" # Replace ""your_script.sh"" with the path to your processing script
done > combined_percentages.txt
```

This approach should help you automate the calculation of read percentages across multiple BAM files, and it can be easily adapted or extended based on your specific requirements.",5,1.0,1

Additionally, consider rechecking the quality of your assembly and ensuring that it is properly indexed before alignment. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Reindex your C. elegans reference genome using `bwa index output/genome/ref/seq/celegans.fa`.
2. Align your de novo assembly to the reference with BWA-MEM, specifying an appropriate seeding option and mapping parameters. For example:
```bash
bwa mem -t 8 -R '@RG\tID=input_assembly,SM\tcelegans' \
    -Y output/genome/ref/seq/celegans.fa input/assembly/celegans/hgap/bristol/assembly.fa > output/alignment/pacbio/bwa/ref/bristolAssembly.sam
```
In this example, `-R` specifies the read group information and `-Y` enables seeding to improve alignment accuracy. Adjust these parameters according to your assembly quality and sequencing platform.

3. Convert the SAM file to BAM format using `samtools view -bS output/alignment/pacbio/bwa/ref/bristolAssembly.sam > output/alignment/pacbio/bwa/ref/bristolAssembly.bam`.
4. Sort and index the BAM file:
```bash
samtools sort output/alignment/pacbio/bwa/ref/bristolAssembly.bam -o output/alignment/pacbio/bwa/ref/bristolAssemblySorted.bam
samtools index output/alignment_sorted.bam
```
5. Visualize the sorted BAM file in IGV using `samtools view -bS output/alignment/pacbio/bwa/ref/bristolAssemblySorted.bam`.

If you still observe a shift after these steps, it may be worth investigating potential issues with your assembly or reference genome quality. You can also try adjusting the seeding parameters and mapping options further to improve alignment accuracy.",5,3.0,3

The filename output will be the same as the sample name, but will substitute lane information with ""merged"". Just run this in your directory with all the bams and you should have merged bams in the dir ""merged""."," To merge all .bam files for each sample, you can use a bash script that iterates over your samples and uses `samtools merge` to combine the four lanes of each sample into one file. Here's an example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the directory containing the .bam files
DIR=""/path/to/your/folder""

# Loop through all samples (S1, S2, ..., S75)
for i in {1..75}; do
    # Construct sample name and lane filenames based on the current iteration
    SAMPLE_NAME=""my_experiment_${i}__L001""
    LANE_FILES=(""$DIR/${SAMPLE_NAME}_S1.bam"" ""$DIR/${SAMPLE_NAME}_S2.bam"" ""$DIR/${SAMPLE_NAME}_S3.bam"" ""$DIR/${SAMPLE_NAME}_S4.bam"")
    
    # Check if all lane files exist before merging
    for file in ""${LANE_FILES[@]}""; do
        if [ ! -f ""$file"" ]; then
            echo ""Error: Missing $file""
            exit 1
        fi
    done
    
    # Merge the four lane files into one .bam file for each sample
    samtools merge ""${SAMPLE_NAME}_merged.bam"" ""${LANE_FILES[@]}""
done
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/folder` with the actual directory containing your .bam files. This script assumes that all samples have a naming convention like `my_experiment_${i}__L001`, where `${i}` represents the sample number (e.g., S1, S2, ..., S75).

To run this script:

1. Save it to a file called `merge_bam_files.sh`.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script (`cd /path/to/your/folder`).
3. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x merge_bam_files.sh`.
4. Execute the script with `./merge_bam_files.sh`.

This will create a merged .bam file for each sample in your folder, named according to their respective naming convention (e.g., `my_experiment_1__L001_merged.bam`, `my_experiment_2__L001_merged.bam`, etc.).",5,5.0,5

Let's break down the key tags from this example:

1. `GA004_0001:5:1:1073:12995#0`: This is the read name, which consists of several parts: chromosome (`chr`), position on that chromosome (starting at 1), flag indicating alignment details, and a unique identifier. In this case, it indicates an aligned read from chromosome 10, starting at position 135,119,228 with flags `5`, `1`, and `1073`.

2. `0`: This is the mapping quality score for the alignment. A higher value (closer to 30) indicates a better-quality alignment. In this case, it's set to 0, which may indicate an issue with the read or its alignment.

3. `chr10`: The chromosome on which the sequence is aligned.

4. `135119228`: The position of the first nucleotide in the reference genome that aligns to this read (start).

5. `37`: This indicates the number of mismatches between the read and its alignment on the reference genome. In this case, there are 37 mismatches.

6. `75M`: The length of the aligned sequence in bases. Here, it's 75 base pairs long.

7. `*`: This indicates that the first nucleotide is a soft-clipped (i.e., not part of the actual alignment). In this case, there are no such clipped bases.

8. The following fields (`0`, `0`) represent additional information about the read:
   - `NM:i:1`: Number of mismatches in the entire sequence. Here, it's 1.
   - `X0:i:1`: Number of clipped bases at the start (left). In this case, there are no such clipped bases.
   - `X1:i:0`: Number of clipped bases within the alignment (right). Again, there are none in this example.
   - `XM:i:1`: Total number of mismatches including those outside the aligned region. Here, it's 1.
   - `XO:i:0`: Number of reads that overlap with other alignments at the same position on the reference genome (multi-mapping). In this case, there are no overlapping reads.
   - `XG:i:0`: GapCount in the alignment. Here, it's 0.
   - `MD:Z:45A29/code`: MD tag provides information about mismatches and gaps within the aligned sequence (in this case, represented as a hexadecimal string). This field is not directly interpretable without additional context or tools to decode its meaning.

To determine if tags are unique hits or multiple hits, you can look at fields like `XO:i` for multi-mapping reads and compare the number of alignments across different samples/groups. If a particular read has more than one alignment (non-zero value in `XO:i`), it's considered a multiple hit. However, this information alone may not be sufficient to draw conclusions about biological significance or experimental errors; further analysis and context are required.",1,0.0,1

Hope this fixes it for you.Try installing samtools with conda-forge included:code>conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda samtools bzip2</code>"," The error message you're encountering with samtools is due to missing `libbz2.so.1` library file which is required by samtools. This issue can be resolved using the steps below:

First, ensure that you have bzip2 installed on your system as it provides the necessary libraries for samtools. You can install or update bzip2 using the following command:

```bash
sudo yum install bzip2-devel
```

After installing bzip2, try to reinstall samtools. This might solve the issue if the library file is not properly linked during the installation process. Use this command to uninstall and then reinstall samtools:

```bash
sudo yum remove samtools && sudo yum install samtools
```

If you still encounter the error, it's possible that your system doesn't have the correct path for the library file. You can try creating a symbolic link to the `libbz2.so.1` file in `/usr/lib64`. However, as you mentioned, this requires root access and might ask for login credentials. If you are running these commands from a terminal with sudo privileges, it should work without asking for your password again if you've already authenticated once:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libbz2.so.1 libbz2.so.1.0
```

Please replace `/usr/lib64` with the actual path where `libbz2.so.1` is located on your system if it's different. You can find this by using the command:

```bash
find / -name ""libbz2.so.1*""
```

Remember to replace `/` with a directory that you have permission to search in, like `/usr/lib64`. 

If none of these steps work, it's possible there might be an issue with your system's library paths or bzip2 installation itself. In such cases, consider seeking help from the community forums specific to your Linux distribution as they can provide more tailored advice based on their experiences and knowledge about common issues in that environment.",5,3.0,3

See also <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.biostars.org/p/342482/"">Which human reference genome should I use?</a>. ALT contigs are typically not included unless you intend to use an ALT-aware alignment pipeline, such as the one in BWAkit. That is typically not necessary unless you are interested in exactly these regions and the variation going on there. Therefore, for standard purposes, do not include them into the reference. The reason is that they represent alternative sequences for regions that are already included in the primary assembly (highly variable regions like MHC) leading to multimapping events between the primary assembly and the ALTs. As most downstream tools typically exclude multimappers, including the ALTs in an ALT-unaware alignment pipeline, eventually leads to a loss of these reads. See also <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/7857/reference-genome-components"">Reference Genome Components</a>. Once you have all the chromsomes and contigs you want to include as <code>fasta</code>, <code>cat</code> them together into one file and index them with BWA. See again <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.biostars.org/p/342482/"">Which human reference genome should I use?</a>."," To include the hg38DH-extra.fa file containing decoy sequences in your alignment process using BWA, you can follow these steps:

1. First, ensure that all necessary index files are created for both the reference fasta (hg38) and its alternate contigs (hg38DH.fa.alt). These index files should be present in the same folder as your input sequence file(s).

2. To include the decoy sequences from hg38DH-extra.fa, you can concatenate this file with the original reference fasta (hg38) and create a new combined FASTA index file for BWA to use during alignment. This step is optional but may help in capturing potential alternative alignments involving decoy sequences.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Concatenate the hg38DH-extra.fa and hg38 files using a command like this (assuming both are in the same folder):
```bash
cat hg38DH-extra.fa hg38 > combined_hg38.fa
```
2. Create BWA index files for the new combined FASTA file:
```bash
bwa index combined_hg38.fa
```
Now, you have a single BWA index file (combined_hg38.idx) that includes both reference and decoy sequences from hg38DH-extra.fa. You can use this index file for alignment with the following command:

```bash
bwa mem combined_hg38.fasta your_input_file.fastq > aligned_output.sam
```
Replace ""your_input_file.fastq"" with the input sequence file you want to align, and `aligned_output.sam` will be the output SAM/BAM file containing the alignment results.

Remember that including decoy sequences in your alignment may affect the accuracy of variant calling or downstream analyses, so it's essential to consider this aspect based on your specific use case and research goals.",5,4.0,3

            # Iterate through the first file and write each read to the output BAM object
            for read in infile1:
                outfile.write(read)

    # Open the second file and merge it with the output BAM object, keeping only unique pairs
    with pysam.AlignmentFile(input2, ""rb"") as infile2:
        with pysam.AlignmentFile(output, ""ab"", template=outfile) as outfile:
            for read in infile2:
                # Check if the pair exists and is not a duplicate (same query name and flag)
                if any(r1.query_name == read.query_name and r1.flag == read.flag for r1 in outfile):
                    continue
                else:
 mantain_paired_end = merge_paired_end('R1_001.fastq.gz', 'R2_001.fastq.gz', 'testSortMerged.bam')

3. Finally, run `samtools markdup` on the merged BAM file:
```bash
samtools markdup -@ 12 testSortMerged.bam > testSortMerged-markdup.bam

# Align reads using BWA, targeting specific regions specified in manifest file
bwa aln -M manifest.txt --end-to-start sample.fastq.gz > sample_aligned.sai
```

In this script:
1. First, load the reference genome index by running `bwa index reference.fa`. Replace ""reference.fa"" with your actual reference file name.
2. Then, run the `bwa aln` command using `-M manifest.txt`, which allows you to specify regions of interest from a manifest file. The `--end-to-start` flag is used to align reads in reverse complement mode if needed (based on your specific requirements). Replace ""manifest.txt"" with your actual manifest file name and ""sample.fastq.gz"" with the input fastq file you want to align.
3. Finally, redirect the output of `bwa aln` command into a new SAM/Sai file named ""sample_aligned.sai"". You can modify this filename as per your preference.

Make sure that your manifest file is formatted correctly and contains the desired regions you want to target for alignment. The format should include chromosome, start position, and end position (e.g., `chr1:100-200`).",5,4.0,4

Specifically, you can utilize `samtools idxstats` or `samtools flagstat` to obtain statistics about each read in the SAM file.

Here's an example workflow:

1. Use `samtools idxstats`: This command will generate a tab-separated table containing information on each mapped read, including its number of alignments (mapped reads). You can save this output to a text file or directly pipe it into your next step.

2. Combine the statistics with your BED file: Once you have obtained the mapping statistics for all reads in your SAM file using `samtools idxstats`, merge this information with your existing bed file generated by `bedtools bamtobed`. You can achieve this by reading both files and merging them based on their common fields (e.g., read name, chromosome, start position).

3. Group reads: After combining the statistics with your BED file, group the entries by read names or other identifying features to ensure each unique read is mentioned only once in the final output. You can use tools like `awk`, `sort` and `uniq` for this purpose.

4. Generate the final bed file: Once you have grouped the reads, generate a new BED file with the desired format by including the number of presentations (mapped reads) as an additional column or field in each entry.

Here's an example using `awk` and `sort`:

```bash
# Assuming your combined statistics and bed files are named stats_file and bed_file respectively:
cat stats_file bed_file | awk 'NR == 1 {print $0; next} /^#/ {next} {print $0, NR}' | sort -k4,4n | uniq > final_bed_file
```

This command will merge the statistics and BED files, add a line number (representing the presentation count) to each entry, sort them by read name or other fields, remove duplicates, and save the result as `final_bed_file`. Adjust the field selection (`-k4,4n`) according to your specific data format.

Remember that this is just an example workflow; you may need to adapt it based on your actual file formats and requirements.",1,4.0,1
"Hi, Given a sorted bam file from standard 10x cell ranger output, i.e. from <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets/4.0.0/sc5p_v1p1_hs_PBMC_1k"">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets/4.0.0/sc5p_v1p1_hs_PBMC_1k</a>, I am wondering if it's possible to convert this scRNA-seq bam file to a bulk RNA-seq (""pseudo-bulk"") bam file, e.g. combining reads across all cell barcodes in the bam file?I imagine there is a way to do this using samtools, but could not find any examples.  Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks!","It's a normal bam file, just with a few extra tags with cell barcodes and such. You can read more about the tags on the 10X website <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/bam"">here</a>. Because there is nothing special about it, you can use any feature counting software designed for RNA-seq, such as Subread or HTSeq."," Yes, it's possible to convert a sorted scRNA-seq BAM file from 10x cell ranger output into a bulk RNA-seq (""pseudo-bulk"") BAM file using samtools and other bioinformatics tools. The general approach involves collapsing reads across all cell barcodes in the BAM file, effectively merging individual cells' data into a single dataset. This process can be achieved through several steps:

1. Load your sorted scRNA-seq BAM file using `samtools view`.
2. Use `awk` or other text processing tools to extract and concatenate reads across all cell barcodes, creating a pseudo-bulk BAM file.
3. Optionally, you can use `picard MarkDuplicates` tool with the `--duplicate_threshold=0` option to remove any remaining duplicate reads that might have been generated during the merging process.
4. Finally, index your resulting bulk RNA-seq BAM file using `samtools index`.

Here's an example workflow:

```bash
# Step 1: Load sorted scRNA-seq BAM file
samtools view input_scRNA-seq.bam > merged_reads.fastq

# Step 2: Extract and concatenate reads across all cell barcodes using awk (example)
awk '{print $0}' merged_reads.fastq | sort -k1,1 >> bulk_rna-seq.fastq

# Step 3: Create a BAM file from the pseudo-bulk FASTQ data
samtools view bulk_rna-seq.fastq > bulk_rna-seq.bam

# Optional step: Remove duplicate reads (if needed)
picard MarkDuplicates I=bulk_rna-seq.bam O=bulk_rna-seq_dedup.bam T=bulk_rna-seq DUPL_THRESHOLD=0

# Step 4: Index the resulting bulk RNA-seq BAM file
samtools index bulk_rna-seq_dedup.bam
```

Please note that this example assumes you're working with FASTQ files, and it merges reads across all cell barcodes using `awk`. Depending on your specific dataset and requirements, you may need to adjust the script accordingly or use other tools like `bedtools` for more complex processing. Additionally, keep in mind that converting scRNA-seq data into bulk RNA-seq format involves some loss of information about individual cells' gene expression profiles, so consider carefully whether this approach aligns with your research goals.",3,4.0,4
"I would like to know how BWA mem handles repetitive hits.I know that bwa aln/samse- given a read that maps to multiple regions- will randomly select one region. Each query will be listed once in the sam file, and alternative mapping locations for that read will be listed in XA if the number of hits is less than INT hits.But what about BWA mem? I keep reading that BWA mem differs from bwa aln in that it will split queries, but what about reads that aren't split but still map to multiple locations? Does mem also chose a random location? Are multiply mapped reads reported in the same fashion in bwa mem as they are for bwa aln/samse (that is, with one listing per query and XAs reported if less than INT)? For simplicity's sake, I am not interested in using other aligners. I have pre-trimmed RAD data (80-139bp) from a frog species with a highly repetitive genome.Thank you.","In general, short read aligners take some liberties in the way they report the alignments - as it turns out bwa is no different.Alas in most cases there is surprisingly little information in the docs on the specifics on what gets reported in which way. The following ismy best understanding of how <code>bwa mem</code> chooses to report alignments:ol>li>When a read matches in its entirety, with an equal score in multiple locations, one of the locations is picked at random, is labeled as primary, will be given a mapping quality of zero and will have an XA tag that contains the alternative locations (this is identical to how <code>bwa aln</code> worked)/li>li>When different, non-overlapping regions of a read align with high scores to different, non-linear locations in the genome, the higher score alignment will be labeled as primary, the others may be reported as secondary alignments. There is some threshold on how many of these secondary alignments will be reported (<code>bwa aln</code> did not produce secondary alignments)/li>li>When complementary regions of a read (the pieces add up to the full read) align to different, non-linear genomic locations, with no little to no overlap, one of the alignments will be labeled as primary, the others as supplementary alignments (<code>bwa aln</code> did not produce supplementary alignments)/li>/ol>"," BWA mem is designed to handle multiple mapping locations differently compared to BWA aln/samse. When dealing with reads that map to multiple regions, BWA mem splits these queries into separate alignments for each potential location. This splitting allows it to report all possible mappings rather than randomly selecting one as in the case of bwa aln/samse.

For a read that isn't split but still maps to multiple locations (i.e., with high sequence similarity), BWA mem will align these reads against each potential location and generate separate SAM records for each alignment, including those with alternative mapping locations. These alternative mappings are reported in the XA fields of the SAM file if there are less than a specified number of hits (INT).

In summary, unlike bwa aln/samse which randomly selects one region per query, BWA mem will split queries and report all possible alignments for each read. This approach ensures that multiple mapping locations are captured in the SAM file, providing more comprehensive information about potential alternative mappings when INT hits threshold is not met.",4,4.0,4

Although you mentioned not seeing any NA values directly, it's possible that there are hidden or non-obvious issues in your dataset causing this error.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Check for missing data: Even though you have used `na.omit()`, ensure that all rows with NA values have been removed from both columns of interest (`Gene symbol` and `mu_p0`). You can use `sum(is.na(mouse))` to check if there are any remaining NAs in your dataset.

2. Verify the data type: Ensure that the numeric variables (e.g., `mu_p0`, `mu_p2_`) have been converted to numeric types before performing clustering. You can use `sapply(mouse, is.numeric)` to check if all columns are of numeric type.

3. Check for outliers: Outliers in the data may cause issues during clustering. Consider using a robust method like median-based hierarchical clustering (e.g., ""median"" as the `method` argument) or removing extreme values before performing clustering.

4. Examine the dataset structure: Ensure that your matrix is correctly formatted and has only numeric data in columns 3 to 8, with row names corresponding to gene symbols. You can use `str(mouse)` to inspect the structure of your dataset.

5. Try a different clustering method: Although ""ward.D2"" works for some datasets, you may want to experiment with other methods like ""average"", ""complete"", or even ""single"" to see if they produce better results without errors.

Here's an updated version of your code incorporating the above suggestions:

```r
library(gplots)
library(pheatmap)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tidyr)

mouse <- Mousebaseline %>% drop_na() # remove rows with NA from the merged file
drnames <- mouse$Gene symbol
mouse <- mouse[-c(1:2)] # remove gene symbol column
mouse.matrix <- as.matrix(mouse)
rownames(mouse.matrix) <- rnames
mouse.matrix <- t(mouse.matrix) # transpose matrix
mouseUT <- scale(mouse.matrix, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE) # scale data without centering or scaling columns individually

# Check for missing values and numeric types
sum(is.na(mouse))  # should be zero if na.omit() was successful
sapply(mouse, is.numeric)  # all columns should return TRUE

pheatmap(mouseUT, scale = ""column"", cluster_rows = T, cluster_cols = T, show_rownames = T, show_colnames = F, clustering_method = ""average"", border_color= NA, main = ""Mouse baseline (Average)"")

Try running this updated code and see if it resolves the error. If not, you may want to further investigate your dataset or consider consulting with a data expert for more in-depth analysis.",3,1.0,1

The provided Python function `cigar2end` calculates the right-most position of an aligned read based on its CIGAR string, which is used by SAM files to describe how sequencing reads align to reference sequences.

Here's what each part of the code does:

1. **Regular Expression**: The `cigar_pat` regular expression pattern matches any sequence of digits followed by a CIGAR operation symbol (M, I, D, N, S, H, P, =, X). This allows us to parse each CIGAR operation in the string separately.

2. **Counts Dictionary**: The `counts` dictionary holds counters for different types of operations found in a CIGAR string:
   - M (match): Represents an alignment match with no gaps.
   - I (insertion): Indicates bases inserted into the reference sequence.
   - D (deletion): Bases that are deleted from the reference sequence.
   - N (skip): Regions in the read that do not align to any position in the reference.
   - S (soft clip): Sequences at the start of a read that have been soft-clipped and thus not included in the alignment.
   - H (hard clip): Sequences at the end of a read that have been hard-clipped and are also not included in the alignment.
   - P (padding): Bases inserted into the reference sequence to pad out reads shorter than the reference.
   - =, X: These symbols represent matches or mismatches within aligned bases.

3. **CIGAR Parsing**: The function iterates over each CIGAR operation using `cigar_pat.findall(cigar)`. For every operation, it extracts the count (number of bases affected by this operation) and the symbol representing the type of operation. It then updates the corresponding counter in the `counts` dictionary.

4. **Calculating Right-most Position**: The function sums up all 'M', 'D', and 'N' counts, which represent aligned reference bases (matches or deletions). This sum gives us the total number of bases that are part of an alignment to the reference sequence. It adds this count to the left-most position (`left`) provided as input to calculate the right-most position of the read in the reference.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated right-most position, which is a floating-point number representing the 1-based index within the reference sequence.

This approach correctly handles various CIGAR operations and provides an accurate calculation for the right-most position of reads aligned onto reverse strands in SAM files. However, it assumes that all soft-clipped bases are not part of the alignment; this is generally true but may require additional logic if there's a need to consider them differently (e.g., when they represent real biological events like indels).",5,4.0,1
"Hi Guys,I have a BAM file, and a big read list. What I want to do is to remove the reads in the read list from the BAM file.

Default value: null./blockquote>"," One efficient approach you can consider for removing reads from your BAM file using Python is by utilizing the `pysam` library along with its built-in functionalities. This method allows you to directly manipulate and filter out unwanted reads without converting the BAM file into SAM format, which saves both time and memory resources.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. Install `pysam` library if not already installed by running `pip install pysam`.
2. Import necessary modules from the `pysam` library, such as `Samfile`, and other required libraries like `csv` or `pandas` for handling your read list file (assuming it's in CSV format).
3. Open both the BAM file using a `Samfile` object and the read list file using pandas DataFrame.
4. Iterate through each entry of the read list, extracting the required information (e.g., read name or sequence) to identify unwanted reads.
5. Use the `inplace` parameter in the `fetch()` method from `pysam` to filter out the unwanted reads directly from your BAM file. This approach avoids creating an intermediate SAM file and performs filtering on-the-fly, which is more memory-efficient.
6. Save the filtered BAM file using the `close()` method of the `Samfile` object or by opening a new BAM file in write mode.

Here's some sample code to illustrate this approach:

```python
import pysam
import pandas as pd

# Load read list into DataFrame (assuming CSV format)
read_list = pd.read_csv('your_read_list.csv')

# Open the BAM file
bamfile = pysam.AlignmentFile(""input.bam"", ""rb"")

# Iterate through each entry in the read list and filter out unwanted reads from the BAM file
for index, row in read_list.iterrows():
    # Extracting required information (e.g., read name) based on your specific needs
    read_name = row['read_name']  # Replace 'read_name' with actual column name containing read names
    
    for aligned_segment in bamfile.fetch(until_eof=True):
        if aligned_segment.query_name == read_name:
            # Remove the unwanted reads using `inplace` parameter and update the BAM file directly
            bamfile.remove(aligned_segment)

# Close the filtered BAM file or open a new one in write mode for saving
bamfile.close()  # Optionally, you can save it to disk by opening another BAM file in write mode: `output = pysam.AlignmentFile('filtered.bam', 'wb')` and then using `write(aligned_segment)` inside the loop
```

This method should provide a more efficient way of removing reads from your BAM file, as it avoids unnecessary conversions between formats and leverages built-in functionalities for on-the-fly filtering.",5,5.0,5
"I have a series of BWA index files ( *.amb *.ann *.bwt, etc) but the original reference fasta sequences are not available.

It definitely should be possible, so I guess the question may be how to do it with existing tools and the least amount of pain.I looked into it, and it seems that from the ""https://github.com/mruffalo/bwt-sw"" rel=""nofollow"">original bwtsw code</a> (that bwa relies on, particularly for the indexing steps), the ""packed"" fasta file (<code>pac</code>) is the key file to use. This is supported by looking at the order of the indexing substeps of <code>fa2pac</code>, <code>pac2bwt</code>, and finally <code>bwt2sa</code>.So as an informed guess I searched for ""pac2fasta"", and (surprisingly to me) found an existing utility in the ""https://github.com/iontorrent/TMAP/"" rel=""nofollow"">TMAP package</a>. I believe, based on some quick tests, that the binary format for their <code>pac</code> file is the same as bwa uses (and bwtsw), aside from some embedded version numbers. The only catch is that TMAP has a binary annotation file (<code>$ref.tmap.anno</code>) that stores the chromosome names and lengths, whereas bwa uses a plaintext annotation file (<code>$ref.ann</code>). So if this is really what you want to do, it looks like you'll have to hardcode things (that's what I did to test with a small single chromosome reference) or write some code to make a TMAP annotation file from a bam header or bwa <code>.ann</code> file (by working through <code>tmap_refseq_write_header</code> in ""https://github.com/iontorrent/TMAP/blob/master/src/index/tmap_refseq.c"" rel=""nofollow"">tmap_refseq.c</a>)."," Yes, it is possible to extract the original FASTA sequences from BWA's Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) index files using specialized tools designed for this purpose. The process involves utilizing software like `bwt2fa` or `samtools faidx`, which can reconstruct the reference genome from its associated indices.

The `bwt2fa` tool, developed by the BWA team, is specifically tailored to convert a Burrows-Wheeler index into FASTA format. It takes in the `.amb`, `.ann`, and `.bwt` files as input and outputs the original reference sequences in FASTA format. Here's an example of how you can use `bwt2fa`:

```bash
bwt2fa -i <index_file>.amb <index_file>.ann <index_file>.bwt > output.fasta
```

Alternatively, the widely-used tool `samtools faidx` also supports extracting FASTA sequences from BWA's index files. This command can be used to retrieve a specific region of interest or the entire reference genome:

```bash
samtools faidx <index_file> > output.fasta
```

Both methods will allow you to recover your original reference FASTA sequences from BWA's index files, assuming that all necessary indices are present and correctly formatted.",4,4.0,4
